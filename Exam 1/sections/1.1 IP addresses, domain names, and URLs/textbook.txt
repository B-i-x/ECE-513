IP addresses
A computer communicates with another computer on the internet by sending packets back and forth.
An internet packet contains To and From IP addresses, the information to communicate, and other
configuration information.
An IP address (short for Internet Protocol address) is a computer's unique address on the internet
(like a house's unique address in the world), usually represented numerically like 198.57 .100.7. A
typical IP address is 32 bits, divided into four 8-bit groups, each group often written as a decimal
number. I PARTICIPATION
ACTIVITY 1 .1 .1: IP addresses.

/ I \ " 11000110 00110011 01100100 00000111
0 = 00000000
255 = 11111111
The following IP address is displayed: 198.57 .100.7. For each section of the IP address, the
corresponding 8 bits value is displayed. The 198 is represented with the 8 bits 71000710, 57 is
007 1 001 1, 100 is 07 100100, and 7 is 000007 11 .
Animation captions:
1. An IP address is usually written as four numbers separated by dots.
2. Each number represents 8 bits of the IP address, for a total of 32 bits.
3. The smallest possible number in an IP address is 0, and the largest is 255.

The original Internet Protocol, known as /Pv4, has 32-bit addresses. 32 bits can represent 232 or about
4 billion unique addresses, originally believed to be more than enough, but 4 billion is no longer
enough. A new version of the Internet Protocol, /Pv6, uses 128-bit addresses, capable of representing
2128 addresses. The number 2128 is 3.4 x 1038 or
340,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, which is hopefully enough for quite a while.
IPv4 and IPv6 currently co-exist and likely will for a long time. I PARTICIPATION

IPv4?

Some websites can be directly reached using the computer system's IP address. Ex: Google could say
"Go to 216.58.193.206 to search the internet." But those numbers are hard to remember, and IP
addresses can change, so domain names are commonly used. A domain name is a name for an IP
address, such as the name wikipedia.org for the IP address 198.35.26.96; the name is easier to
remember and type. Capitalization doesn't matter: Wikipedia.org, wikipedia.org, and WIKIPEDIA.ORG
are treated the same.
When a computer sends a packet using a domain name over the internet, the first step is to contact a
DNS server to convert the domain name to an IP address. DNS is short for Domain Name System.
Thirteen main DNS servers (called root servers) exist in the world, and a computer's operating system
or an ISP keeps a reference to the root servers' IP addresses. Ex: 198.41 .0.4 (run by Verisign),
192.228.79.201 (run by USC), 199.7.91 .13 (run by Univ. of Maryland), and 192.203.230.10 (run by
NASA). The first step of sending an internet packet to a domain name is thus to lookup the IP address
via a DNS server.

A computer is displayed with the following IP address: 198.57 .100.0. A packet is displayed right next
to the 198.51 .100.0 computer with the information: To: cnn.com, From: 198.51.100.00, Type: Web
Access, Data:. Then another packet is sent to a DNS server to get the IP address for cnn.com. This
packet retrieves 157.166.226.25 under Data: and sends it to the original packet. Now the original
packet has the IP address for cnn.com, which is 157.166.226.25.

1. A computer wants to send a packet to cnn.com.
2. First, a packet is sent to a DNS server to lookup the IP address for cnn.com.
3. The packet contains the destination address. The computer can now communicate with CNN.
Registering a domain name
Anyone may register an unused domain name with a domain name registrar. Most
registrars charge a yearly fee for keeping the domain registered. Registration
information is made publicly available from ICANN's Whois service.

When a website is hosted with a web hosting company, the company will update the
DNS servers so the website's domain name is associated with the IP address of the
hosted website. The web hosting company may also manage the yearly registration of
the domain name.

Given an IP address, some sites will indicate the geographic location of that IP address'
computer. Try entering 171.67.215.200, which is Stanford.corn's IP address, whose
computers are in Palo Alto, California.
• Click to open www.iplocation.net.
Typing "What is my IP?" in a search engine can be used to determine one's IP address.

Domain name levels
Domain names are hierarchical. A domain name belongs to one of numerous top-level domains (TLD),
such as .com, .net, .org, .edu, and .gov. Also, each country is assigned a unique two-letter country code
top-level domain (ccTLD) like .uk (United Kingdom), .ru (Russia), and .de (Germany). IANA, the
organization that manages TLDs, allows companies and organizations to create customized TLDs, like
.church, .pizza, and .music.

A branch diagram is displayed with each branch explaining the domain name of websites. The
Commercial websites are represented with a .com domain name, Network websites are
represented with a .net domain name, Organization websites are represented with a .org domain
name, Education websites are represented with a .edu domain name, and Government sites are
represented with a .gov domain name.
Animation captions:
1. Internet domain names are divided by top-level domains.
2. The most popular is .com. Most companies have a .com name.
3. Next most popular is .net. Typically for networking/internet-focused companies.
4. Next is .org, traditionally for non-profit organizations.

5. Other well-known top-level domains are .edu for colleges, and .gov for U.S. governments.
Hundreds more exist.
Immediately after a top-level domain comes a second-level domain, such as wikipedia in
wikipedia.org. A second-level domain is commonly an organization's name as in Stanford.edu, or
indicates the purpose of a website as in DoPython.org. Third-level and further level domains refer to
sub-computer systems local to an organization, as in cs.stanford.edu where the cs is for Stanford's
Computer Science department. A common third-or-deeper-level domain is www, short for World Wide
Web, usually referring to an organization's web server. Many organizations use www optionally, so
stanford.edu by default goes to www.stanford.edu.

The top-down structure of a domain name is, somewhat counterintuitively, from rightto-
left rather than left-to-right. Thus, cs.stanford.edu has a top-level domain of .edu,
second-level stanford, and third-level cs. Common scams use this counterintuitive rightto-
left feature to trick people into thinking a site belongs to a particular company Ex:
bankofamerica.xxyz.com might trick a person into thinking the domain name is for Bank
of America.
URLs
►
Domain names are most commonly seen in URLs. A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the location
of a web resource on the web, such as http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/faqs.htm. A web resource is any
retrievable item, like an HTML file, image, video, CSS stylesheet, etc.
A URL is composed of several parts:
• Scheme - Characters at the beginning of a URL followed by a colon":" or a colon and double
slashes"://". Common URL schemes include http, https, mail to, and file . Ex: In
https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol, the scheme is "https".
• Hostname - The complete domain name following the scheme in a URL. Ex: In
https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol, the hostname is "www.cdc.gov".
• Path - The characters to the right of the hostname in a URL. Ex: In https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol,
the path is "/alcohol".
• Query string - Optional characters to the right of the question mark(?) in a URL that provide data
for the web server. In https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu7XCEMdSHg, the characters after
the? tells You Tube's server to play a video having code uu7XCEMdSHg.
• Fragment - Optional characters at the end of a URL that start with a hash character(#) and refer
to a certain location within a webpage. In https://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/URL#History, the
fragment "#History" refers to the webpage's History section.

Webpage errors
zyBooks
If a domain name is not found by a DNS server (usually because the domain name is not registered), a
page is displayed indicating such, as in "Sorry, the website www.xyz.blahblahblah cannot be found."
A domain name may be found (so a valid IP address exists for that name) but the web server may not
respond, resulting in a message like 'The website is not responding" or "Could not reach the website".
Such non-response could be due to the web server being turned off or undergoing maintenance, or
due to an essential router malfunctioning, for example.
If a web server is reached but the specific requested page isn't found, the server returns a 404 status
code, which is a code number for page not found. Various other status codes exist. Many web servers
return a page that includes the number "404".
