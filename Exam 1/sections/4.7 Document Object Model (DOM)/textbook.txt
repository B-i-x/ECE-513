DOM structure
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a data structure corresponding to the HTML document
displayed in a web browser. A DOM tree is a visualization of the DOM data structure. A node is an
individual object in the DOM tree. Nodes are created for each element, the text between an
element's tags, and the element's attributes.
• The root node is the node at the top of the DOM.
• A child node is the node directly under another node. A node can have zero, one, or more child
nodes (children).
• A parent node is the node directly above another node. All nodes, except the root node, have
one parent node. I PARTICIPATION

The following code snippet is displayed:
<html>
<title>Moby-Dick</title>
<body>
<p class="big">Call me Ishmael. Some years ago ... </p>
<p> There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes ... </p>
</body>
<head>
A legend contains a green element node, a blue text node, and a pink attribute node.
A tree is shown. At the top of the tree is an element node named html with two child element
nodes: head and body. Head has a child element node title, which also has a child text node
"Moby-Dick". Body has two p child element nodes. The first p node has an attribute node
connected to it labeled class=big, and a child text node that reads: "Ca ll me Ishmael. Some years
ago ... ". The second p node has only one child text node that reads : "There now is your insular city
of the Manhattoes ... ".
Step 1:
The web browser reads the HTML and creates the DOM's root node from the html element.
Step 2:
Although no head element exists in the HTML, a head node is created as a child of the html node.
The title node is added as a child of the head node.
Step 3:
A text node is created for the title element's text content.
Step 4:

81 of 159 2024-10-12, 4:47 p.m.
The body node is a child of the root node. The p element is contained within the body element, so
the p node is a child of the body node.
Step 5:
An attribute node is created for the p element's class attribute. Attribute nodes are always
connected to element nodes and are not considered children.
Step 6:
The browser continues reading the HTML and creating DOM nodes.
Animation captions:
1. The web browser reads the HTML and creates the DOM's root node from the html element.
2. Although no head element exists in the HTML, a head node is created as a child of the html
node. The title node is added as a child of the head node.
3. A text node is created for the title element's text content.
4. The body node is a child of the root node. The p element is contained within the body
element, so the p node is a child of the body node.
5. An attribute node is created for the p element's class attribute. Attribute nodes are always
connected to element nodes and are not considered children.
6. The browser continues reading the HTML and creating DOM nodes.
An idealized representation of the DOM tree excludes text nodes that only contain whitespace.
However, a web developer occasionally needs to know the complete DOM tree, which includes
whitespace as shown in the example below.

Ctrl+Shift+C on Windows or Ctrl+Option+C on a Mac. The DOM may differ from the

Searching the DOM
JavaScript is commonly used to search the DOM for a specific node or set of nodes and then
change the nodes' attributes or content. Ex: In an email application, the user may click a Delete
button to delete an email. The JavaScript must search the DOM for the node containing the email's
contents and then change the contents to read "Email deleted".
The object provides five primary methods that search the DOM for specific nodes:
1. The document.getE/ementByld() method returns the DOM node whose attribute is the
same as the method's parameter.
Ex: returns the p node in the HTML
below.
2. The document.getE/ementsByTagName() method returns an array of all the DOM nodes
whose type is the same as the method's parameter.
Ex: returns an array containing the four Ii
nodes from in the HTML below.
class
document.getElementsByClassName("traditional")
ol class
document.querySelectorAll("li a")
querySelector()
querySelectorAll()
document.querySelector("li")
getElementById() querySelector()

3. The document.getE/ementsByC/assName() method returns an array containing all the DOM
nodes whose attribute matches the method's parameter.
Ex:
containing the node with the
returns an array
attribute matching the word traditional.
4. The document.querySelectorA/1() method returns an array containing all the DOM nodes that
match the CSS selector passed as the method's parameter.
Ex: returns an array containing the two anchor
nodes in the HTML below.
5. The document.querySe/ector() method returns the first element found in the DOM that
matches the CSS selector passed as the method's parameter. expects
the same types of parameters as but only returns the first element
found while navigating the DOM tree in a depth-first traversal.
Ex: returns the Ii node about Fortran.
A DOM search method name indicates whether the method returns one node or an array of nodes.
If the method name starts with "getElements" or ends in "All", then the method returns an array,
even if the array contains one node or is empty. and
either return a single node or null if no node matches the method arguments. I PARTICIPATION I . . ACTIVITY 4.7.3: Searching the DOM by 1d and by element.

HTMLCollection and Nodelist
Technically, getElementsByTagName () and
return an HTMLCollection, and querySelec returns a NodeList.
HTMLCollection is an interface representing a generic collection of elements. A
NodeList is an object with a collection of nodes. HTMLCollection and NodeList both
act like an array Both have a length property, and elements can be accessed with
braces. Ex: el emen tLi st [ o J is the ftrst element in an HTMLCollection or NodeList.

Modifying DOM node content
After searching the DOM for an element, JavaScript may be used to examine or change the
element's content.
Two common properties are used to get or set an element's content:
1 . The textContent property gets or sets a DOM node's text content. Ex:
changes the
paragraph to
2. The innerHTML property gets or sets a DOM node's content, including all of the node's
children, using an HTML-formatted string. Ex:
changes the paragraph to 1g></ p >.
0
The property uses an internal parser to create any new DOM nodes ...... - ....... ,.... - - ..... - - ,
however, only creates or changes a single text node. For setting an element's text, is
somewhat faster than because no HTML parsing is performed.

Less common ways to change node content
The node Value property gets or sets the value of text nodes. As the DOM tree represents
textual content separately from HTML elements, the textual content of an HTML element is
the first child node of the HTML element's node. So, to access the textual content of an
HTML element within the DOM, firstChilc

3. Uses n ode Value to update the content.

to text Content, but innerText is aware of how text is rendered in the browser. Ex: In
