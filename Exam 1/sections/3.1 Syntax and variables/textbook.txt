Background
In 1995, Brendan Eich created JavaScript so the Netscape Navigator browser could dynamically
respond to user events. Ex: The web page's content could change when the user clicked a button or
hovered over an image.
JavaScript was standardized by Ecma International in 1997 and called ECMAScript. Ecma
International continues to improve ECMAScript, releasing a new version each year. JavaScript is an
implementation of the ECMAScript specification.
Today, JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages. JavaScript is supported by
every major web browser and makes web applications like Gmail and Google Maps possible.
JavaScript is also popular outside the web browser. Ex: Node.js, which runs JavaScript, is a popular
technology for creating server-side web applications.
JavaScript is executed by an interpreter. An interpreter executes programming statements without
first compiling the statements into machine language. Modern JavaScript interpreters (also called
JavaScript engines) use just-in-time (JIT) compilation to compile the JavaScript code at execution
time into another format that can be executed quickly.
ECMAScript name
The name "ECMAScript" was a compromise between Netscape, Microsoft, and other
organizations involved in the standardization of JavaScript. Brendan Eich once
commented that "ECMAScript was always an unwanted trade name that sounds like
a skin disease." Despite ECMAScript's similarity to eczema (a group of related skin
diseases), the name has stuck.

Variables
A variable is a named container that stores a value in memory. A variable declaration is a
statement that declares a new variable with the keyword /et followed by the variable name. Ex:
declares a variable named score.

A variable may be assigned a value after being declared. An assignment assigns a variable with a
value, like . A variable may also be assigned a value on the same line when the variable
is declared, which is called initializing the variable. Ex:
to 5.
initializes
A variable may be assigned a value without first declaring the variable, but good practice is to always
declare a variable before assigning a value to the variable.

Animation content:
The following code is displayed:
// Declaring a variable
let numSongs;
// Variable is assigned a number
numSongs = 5;
// Variable is declared and assigned a number (initialized)
let numAlbums = 20;
// Variable may be assigned a value without first being declared
hitCount = 1 0;
The first step runs: let numSongs;. The variable numSongs gets allocated a block of memory.
The second step runs: numSongs = 5;. The block of memory that was allocated to numSongs
now stores the value 5.
The third step runs: let numAlbums = 20. The variable numAlbums gets allocated memory and
assigned to 20 at the same time.
The fourth step runs: hitCount = 10. The allocation and assignment of memory is shown just like
the third step but with variable hitCount and value 10.
Animation captions:
1. The numSongs variable is declared with the "let" keyword.
2. numSongs is assigned with 5.
3. numAlbums is initialized with 20.
4. When hitCount is assigned with 10, hitCount is implicitly declared. Good practice is to
explicitly declare all variables with "let".
A name created for an item like a variable is called an identifier. JavaScript imposes the following
rules for identifiers:
• An identifier can be any combination of letters, digits, underscores, or$.
• An identifier may not start with a digit.
• An identifier may not be a reserved word like , or

A JavaScript coding convention is to name JavaScript variables with camel casing, where the
identifier starts with a lowercase letter, and subsequent words begin with a capital letter. Ex:
is preferred over or
A constant is an initialized variable whose value cannot change. A JavaScript constant is declared
with the const keyword. Ex: creates a constant
that is always 8.

A variable may also be declared with the keyword, which is covered elsewhere in

Data types
0
Variables are not explicitly assigned a data type. JavaScript uses dynamic typing, which determines
a variable's type at run-time. A variable can be assigned a value of one type and re-assigned a value
of another type. Ex: assigns with a number type, then a string type.

Comments and semicolons

uses the and operators to produce comments in code.

JavaScript does not require that statements be terminated with a semicolon. Only when two
statements reside on the same line must a semicolon separate the two statements. Good practice
is to avoid placing two statements on the same line. Some developers prefer to use semicolons at
the end of statements, and others do not. Good practice is to consistently use semicolons or not
throughout the code.

Input and output
In a web browser, a JavaScript program may obtain text input from the user with the
function. The prompt() function prompts the user with a dialog box that allows the user to type a
single line of text and press OK or Cancel. The function returns the string the user typed
or if the user pressed Cancel.
Output may be produced using the function console.log(), which displays text or numbers in the
console. The console is a location where text output is displayed. Web browsers have a console
(accessible from the browser's development tools) that displays output from code the browser
executes. This chapter's activities display the console output in the web page.

The first step of the animation runs: let name= prompt("What is your name?");. This opens a
dialog box that displays What is your name? and a place to input text below.
The second step shows the string Becky being input for the dialog box.
The third step shows the variable name getting allocated memory and getting assigned the value
Becky.
The fourth step runs: console.log("Hello," +name+"!"); and displays Hello, Beckyl in the console
Animation captions:
1. The prompt() function displays a dialog box with the given prompt text.
2. The user types her name and presses the OK button.
3. The name variable is assigned with the entered text.
4. console.log() outputs "Hello,", then the value of the name variable, then "I" to the console.

value of tvshow is displayed in the console. Change the code to prompt the user for the
user's favorite TV show. Then, display"_ is your favorite TV show!" in the console. Press
"Run JavaScript" to run your code.
Note: The console will display an error message if the JavaScript interpreter detects a
syntax error. A syntax error is the incorrect typing of a programming statement. Ex:
Forgetting to place "quotes" around a string value is a syntax error.
