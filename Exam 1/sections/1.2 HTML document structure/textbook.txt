HTML, elements, and tags

acronym highlights the three main characteristics of webpages: I PARTICIPATION

HTML defines over 130 elements. An element is a single HTML structure. Elements are represented
with HTML tags.
An HTML tag is a markup instruction identified by<, the tag name, and>.
• An opening tag indicates the element's starting point in the document.
• A closing tag indicates the element's ending point in the document.
Ex: <strong>Hello</ strong> causes Hello to appear in a strong weighted font; <strong> is the
opening tag,</ strong> is the closing tag, and everything from the opening tag to the closing tag is
the element. While tag names can be uppercase or lowercase, good practice is to use lowercase letters
for the tag names, as in <strong>Hello</ strong> rather than <Strong>Hello</ Strong>
Some elements, like <br> and <img>, do not have a closing tag. A void element is an element that
only needs an opening tag.

The HTML Living Standard, produced by WHATWG, defines the minimal parts of an HTML document:
1. The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration instructs the web browser about what type of document
follows.
2. The <html> element encloses everything but the<! DOCTYPE html> declaration.
<html lang="en "> indicates that the document's language is English.
3. The <head> element contains the document title, document metadata, and various other
elements that are typically not displayed in the webpage.

4. The <meta> element specifies metadata, which is data that describes the document's data.
<meta charset="UTF-8 "> describes how characters are represented in the HTML
document. Additional <meta> tags may be used to indicate when the document was saved,
who the author is, etc.
5. The <title> element specifies the document's name. The title is usually displayed in the browser's
titlebar, is used by search engines, and is used for bookmarking.
6. The <body> element encloses all elements and content to be rendered in the browser.
The opening <html> tag uses an attribute to indicate the webpage's language, and <meta> uses an
attribute to indicate the character set. An element attribute provides additional information about the
element and is included only in the opening tag. An attribute has a name and a value, specified using
the form: name="value". Ex: <meta charset="UTF-8 "> has an attribute named char set with
value "UTF-8".

End of code snippet. My First Webpage is displayed above a browser. The browser displays "Hello,
World!"
Animation captions:
1. The document starts with <!DOCTYPE html>, which instructs the browser how to interpret the
rest of the document.
2. The <html> opening and closing tags mark the beginning and ending of the document. The
lang attribute indicates the document's language is English.
3. The <head> opening and closing tags enclose the <meta> and <title> elements.
4. The <body> opening and closing tags enclose the document's contents. The browser displays
the document body in the webpage.
Notes
◄
Omitting the DOCTYPE from an HTML document or placing any characters before the
DOCTYPE causes the web browser to render the document in quirks mode. Quirks
mode is a browser rendering mode that renders a webpage using non-standard layout
rules emulating older web browsers. A webpage with the DOCTYPE is rendered using
standards mode, which uses the HTML Living Standard.
The character set <meta> tag may be omitted if the webpage is served from a web
server that indicates the character encoding in the HTTP Content-Type header. UTF-
8 is a common character encoding that describes characters used by most of the
world's languages. UTF-8 even includes fictional languages (e.g., Klingon, Elvish) and
emoji (e.g., @, +-).
The <head> element is optional but is included anyway in most webpages.

Learning HTML is best performed by entering new HTML into a webpage and viewing
the results in the web browser. A web server is not necessary to create a webpage
that can only be viewed on your desktop or laptop computer.
Try the following:
1. Open your favorite text editor. Popular text editors include Sublime Text,
Notepad++. and Visual Studio Code.
2. Create a new file.
3. Enter the HTML from the animation above into the file.
4. Save the file to your computer's hard drive as hello.html. The file extension
. html is necessary for your browser to know the text file contains HTML.
5. Using Chrome or your favorite web browser, open hello.html by pressing Ctrl+O
on Windows or Cmd+O on a Mac. Other ways to open the file include doublehttps:

Viewing a page's HTML
□ , .
A user on a desktop/laptop computer can instruct a browser to show a webpage's HTML. A web
search for "View webpage HTML in Chrome" (or another browser) yields instructions. Ex: In Chrome,
right-clicking (Windows) or Ctrl-clicking (Mac) and choosing "View page source" from the menu shows
the webpage's HTML. A quicker method is to use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+U (Windows) or
~+Option+U (Mac). Most webpages use complex HTML with CSS and JavaScript, so the HTML can
be hard to read.

A user can also use a browser's development tools to view a webpage's HTML elements. Chrome
DevTools is a collection of web development tools that are built into the desktop Chrome browser.
Pressing Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows) or ~+Option+I (Mac) opens Chrome DevTools. Other desktop
browsers have similar development tools.
A browser's development tools show the browser's internal representation of a webpage's elements.
The browser's internal representation and the webpage's actual HTML may differ slightly.

HTML validator
Some elements that were used in earlier versions of HTML are now deprecated in the HTML Living
Standard. A deprecated feature is part of a language that is officially discouraged because newer or
better features exist, or because the deprecated feature is no longer considered safe. Ex: The
<center> element is an officially deprecated element that should no longer be used.
Browsers handle improperly structured HTML and deprecated elements differently and unpredictably.
The only way to have predictable browser behavior is to use valid HTML. An HTML validator checks
that an HTML document conforms to the standard. Good practice is to use tools like the W3C MarkuQ
Validator to check document conformance.
IAP ACRTTIVICITIPYA TION 1.2.7: HTML standardization and validation.
Use the W3C MarkuR Validator to check the given HTML for correctness.
