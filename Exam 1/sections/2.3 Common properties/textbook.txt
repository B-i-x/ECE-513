Color property
5
The color CSS property changes the text color to a specified color value. A color value can be
specified in several ways:
• CSS defines 140 color names. Ex: white, blue, black, gray, forestgreen, magenta.

• An RGB color value specifies a color using the rgb(red, green, blue) function by indicating the
red, green, and blue intensities. Each intensity for red, green, and blue is between O and 255,
where O is the lowest intensity and 255 is the highest.
Ex: is black, is blue, is yellow, and
is white.
• A hexadecimal color specifies a color using the format by indicating the red, green,
and blue intensities. Each intensity for red, green, and blue is between 00 and FF hexadecimal
numbers, where 00 is the lowest intensity and FF is the highest.
Ex: is black, is blue, is yellow, and is white.
• An HSL color value specifies a color using the hsl(hue, saturation, lightness) function by
indicating the hue, saturation, and lightness values. The hue value ranges between O and 360,
and the saturation and lightness values range between 0% and 100%. Ex:
is black, is green, and is dark red.
The HSL color specification method is harder to understand and is not used as frequently as
the RGB and hexadecimal color specification methods.
• The RGB and HSL color values can add an alpha value to allow for transparency. The RGBA
color value specifies a color using the rgba(red, green, blue, alpha) function by indicating the
red, green, blue, and alpha intensities. The HSLA color value specifies a color using the
hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha) function by indicating the hue, saturation, lightness,
and alpha intensities. The intensities have the same ranges as for RGB or HSL color values,
but the alpha intensity is between O and 1. An alpha of O means fully transparent, 1 means
fully opaque, and 0.5 means half transparent.

Background properties
Every element in a webpage has a set of background properties. The web browser first draws the
element's background and then the element's content. If the element's background is not fully
opaque, the element's parent is visible under the element's content. Common background
properties include:
• The background-color property specifies the background color.
• The background-image property specifies a background image.
• The background property is shorthand for setting several of the element's background
properties at the same time.
Background colors are specified using color names, a color function (RGB, RGBA, HSL, HSLA), or
one of the values such as . Background images are specified with the value or
the url('URL) function, where URL indicates the location of the image. By default, the initial
background color is and background image is , which means the element's
parent's background will display underneath the elemenfs content. When a background color and
image are both specified, the background image is rendered on top of the color. I PARTICIPATION I . . ACTIVITY 2.3.3: Styling background color and image.

• - Element floats to parent container's right side
The clear property moves elements below previously floated elements. Values for the
property include:
• - Element allowed to float (default value)

The <span class="display2">pen</span> is mightier than the sword.
</p>
<p>
All good things come to those who <span class="display2">wait</span>.
</p>
Step 1: The browser displays: "Actions speak louder than words." with a blue background that
spans the entire browser width.
Step 2: After changing the CSS, the blue background shrinks to displaying only behind the
paragraph's words .
Step 3: The browser displays 'The pen is mightier than the sword.", and the word "pen" has a
yellow background.
Step 4: After changing the CSS, the word "pen" moves to the next line, and the yellow background
expands to fill the browser width.
Step 5: The browser displays "All good things come to those who wait.". After changing the CSS,
the word "wait" disappears, and the period slides to the left after "who" and a space.
Animation captions:
1. The p element is a block element, and a block element fills the width of the element's
container.
2. Adding display:inline to the display1 class makes the p element be treated as an inline
element. The blue background now is only as wide as the paragraph contents.
3. The span element is an inline element, so the span's content is shown on the same line as
the surrounding text.
4. Adding display:block to the display2 class make the span be treated as a block element.
The span's content now displays on a separate line.
5. The span's content displays by default, but adding display:none to the display3 class hides
the span's contents.

CSS variables
Many websites have complex stylesheets with repeated values. Ex: The same background color
may be used in numerous places, and changing the background color requires searching and
replacing throughout the stylesheet. CSS variables simplify the process of creating CSS values that
are used repeatedly in a stylesheet.
A CSS variable is a custom CSS property that defines a value. A CSS variable is declared in a CSS
selector that defines the variable's scope. A CSS variable can have global scope by declaring the
variable in the :root selector, which targets the highest DOM element: the element.
A CSS variable is defined with two dashes preceding the variable name. Ex:
A CSS variable is accessed with the var() function. Ex:
