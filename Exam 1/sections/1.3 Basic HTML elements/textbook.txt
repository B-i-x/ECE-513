Paragraphs
The <p> element creates a paragraph in an HTML document. A paragraph is enclosed in HTML by the
<p> opening and </p> closing tags. Browsers visually separate paragraphs from other text with
spacing above and below.
A common error is forgetting the closing <Ip> tag, or trying to put a paragraph inside of another
paragraph. The web browser might render nested <p> tags visually correct, but an HTML validator will
generate an error.

The following HTML is an example with two paragraphs. Notice that blank lines do not start
a new paragraph in the rendered webpage. Add <p> and </p> tags around each paragraph
so that the rendered webpage shows two paragraphs. Try adding extra spaces and blank
lines between words to see how the rendered HTML changes.

Whitespace and line breaks
zyBooks
A whitespace character is an unprinted character such as the spaces between words and lines of text.
Browsers treat all sequences of whitespace as a single space between non-whitespace characters.
Ex: The three spaces in the HTML "hello there" will be displayed with a single space "hello there".
Whitespace characters include spaces, tabs, and newlines. So, a browser treats multiple lines of text
as a single space.
The <br> element creates a line break in a paragraph, such that the content after the line break
appears on a new line. The <br> element is a void element, so only the opening tag is needed. Good
practice is to use <br> when the line break is essential to the content, such as lines in a poem or
mailing address, and not just to add spacing for formatting a webpage. CSS, discussed elsewhere,
should be used for formatting a webpage.

Sections and headings
zyBooks
A section is a collection of related content created with a <section> element. Many documents can be
organized into sections, with each section being wrapped in a <section> element. Ex: A scholarly
article's abstract, introduction, main content, and references can each be wrapped in a <section>
element.
A heading provides a title for each section. Headings are bold by default and are visually separated
from the other text by extra spacing. Heading elements exist for the first six levels of sections: <h1>,
<h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>. Headings are helpful to users who skim through a webpage, to
assistive technologies like screen readers, and to search engines.
Good practice is to label each section with a heading and to select a heading element that matches the
document's hierarchical structure. A common error is to choose a heading element based on the
desired font size.

Text formatting
zyBooks
A number of HTML elements cause the enclosed text to render in a different font in the browser:
0
0
• The <em> element indicates emphasized text, such as text having an emphasized pronunciation
when spoken, and is italicized by default.
• The <strong> element indicates text that has strong importance, and is bolded by default.
• The <cite> element denotes a title, such as a book or song title, and is italicized by default. Ex:
<cite>Spaceballs</cite> is a parody of the <cite>Star Wars</cite> tril
yields: Spaceballs is a parody of the Star Wars trilogy.
• The <mark> element denotes important content that should be semantically highlighted and is
rendered with a yellow background by default. Ex:
<mark>Highlight</mark> what is important. yields: Highlight what is important.
• The <b> element indicates text that needs attention, like key words in a document abstract or
product names in a review, and renders the text in bold. Ex: Mix the flour and oil together.
• The <i> element indicates text in an alternative voice, such as a word or phrase in a foreign
language, and is rendered using italics. Ex: Dashi is a stock used in Japanese cooking.
• The <u> element denotes text that should appear differently from normal text, such as
misspelled words, and is underlined by default. Ex: Misspelled is often misspelled as mispelled.

Historically, in HTML4, the <b>, <i>, and <u> elements were used to render text and
did not have meaning, or semantics. Good practice is to avoid formatting elements
whenever possible, and instead use elements to indicate meaning. Ex: The <i> element
can be used to emphasize text, but the <em> element should be used to convey
emphasis.
