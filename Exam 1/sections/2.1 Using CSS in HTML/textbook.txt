Introduction to CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a textual language for describing how a webpage is styled for
visual presentation. Web browsers use CSS to determine how a webpage is rendered on the screen,
printed to paper, or presented via other media. The CSS acronym highlights the two main
characteristics of presenting a webpage: I PARTICIPATION I . ACTIVITY 2.1.1: Understanding the CSS acronym.

Cascading Style Sheet
The process of combining multiple
style rules and resolving conflicting
styles.
Describes the visual presentation of
structured documents.

□
A web developer uses CSS to write a list of rules. A CSS rule consists of a selector followed by a
declaration block between braces ( ).
• A CSS selector specifies the HTML elements to which the specific style rule applies.
• A declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons ( ).
• A CSS styling declaration is a CSS property followed by a colon (·)and the property value.

block
}
property value
Semicolons are only required to separate rule declarations. A common error is to forget the
separating semicolon when adding a new declaration to a declaration block. Good practice is to place
each declaration on a separate line and to add a semicolon to the end of each declaration block, even
when a semicolon is not required, so that adding the semicolon is not forgotten later when adding
more declarations.

1. An inline style places CSS declarations inside an element's style attribute.
2. An embedded stylesheet places CSS rules in an HTML document's head using a
element.
3. An external stylesheet places CSS rules in a separate file that is imported into an HTML
document with a element.

This embedded stylesheet turns the sentence, "I'm orange." to orange.

Animation captions:
1. An inline style uses an element's style attribute to turn the paragraph text green.
2. An embedded stylesheet defines CSS rules in the <style> element. The p selector makes all
paragraphs have orange text.
3. A <link> element imports an external stylesheet into an HTML document. styles.css makes
all paragraphs have purple text.

Inheritance and conflict
Every browser has a default stylesheet that specifies styling for each HTML element. Ex: The
default style declarations for elements typically specify a bold-weighted font that is twice the
normal font size. CSS style declarations override the default style declarations.
The style declarations from a parent element cascade down and are applied to any child elements,
a concept called inheritance. Each element inherits the style declarations from the element's
parent. The element's parent inherits style declarations from the parent's parent element, and so on
up to the top-level element.
When two style declarations with identical properties apply to the same element, a conflict occurs.
Two common conflicts include:
1. A parent's style declaration conflicts with a child's style declaration. Ex: The parent element's
text is blue, but a child element's style declaration indicates the color should be green. When a
conflict occurs, the child's declaration overrides the parent's declaration.
2. An embedded or external stylesheet's style declaration conflicts with an inline style. Ex: An
inline style says the element should be blue, but the embedded stylesheet says the element
should be green. When a conflict occurs, an inline style overrides the embedded or external
stylesheet's declaration.
Specificity and !important
The browser uses specificity, a scoring system that resolves more complex CSS
conflicts, to determine what style declarations apply to an element. See the
"Exploring further" section below for more information on CSS specificity
The !important rule may be used on a style declaration to override other declarations
and disregard specificity Ex: { col or: 1 makes the
paragraph red, even if an inline style attempts to make the paragraph green.
Stylesheets that use! important are hard to understand and difficult to maintain,
so good practice is to avoid using ! importa

2. The embedded stylesheet uses a p selector to color all paragraph text orange.
3. The embedded stylesheet uses a span selector to color all span text green. The first span's
color overrides the parent's color.
4. The second span's inline style overrides the embedded stylesheet, so the text is blue.
5. The third paragraph's inline style overrides the embedded stylesheet, so the text is red.
