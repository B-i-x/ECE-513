A form is displayed with the input boxes "First Name" and "Last Name" with a button at the
bottom called "Submit." The user inputs "Sarah" for the first name, and "Connor" for the last name.
When the user presses the button, the information is sent to a database on the server. The
"Database on server" is also shown, with "Sarah" highlighted in the "First Name" column, and
"Connor" highlighted in the "Last Name" column.

The GET method is a technique used by a web browser to submit information to a web server by
altering the URL of the HTTP request. When a user clicks the submit button in a form that uses the
GET method, the browser performs the following steps:
1. Collect all data from the form fields into a query string. The query string is a set of
name=value pairs separated by the ampersand character (&). Each name is specified as an
attribute of the HTML field, and the value is the user-entered data. Ex: The first and last field
names and values in the animation below become the string: .c, -· st.-I',._;__ '- i-. °' j__e1.;:, L-
2. Create a URL with the server page and name=value pairs. The URL is composed of the action
attribute specified in the form, the question mark character(?), and the query string. Ex:
3. Use the newly created URL to create and send an HTTP GET request.
4. Display or update the webpage using the HTTP response received from the server.

</body>
End of code snippet. A form is displayed with the inputs "First Name" and "Last Name" and a
button called "Submit." The first name is filled in with "Rick" and the last name is filled in with
"Deckard." When the submit button is clicked, the first and last name are used to create the URL
for example.com with the flrst=Rick and last=Deckard appended onto the end. The browser then
uses a GET request with the created URL to submit the form data to the web server. Then the
web server responds with a new page that shows one line ''Thank you, Rick Deckard!"
Animation captions:
1. The user enters information in the form and clicks the submit button.
2. The browser creates a query string of name=value pairs for each form field, separated by&.
3. The query string is appended to the URL from the form action.
4. The browser uses the new URL to submit the form data to the web server.
5. The web server responds with a new webpage.
Warning
Because submitting form data with the GET method places the form data in the URL,
the data is visible to anyone who sees the URL. The GET method should not be used
to submit private information like phone numbers, credit card information, etc.

The POST method is a technique used by a web browser to submit information to a web server by
sending the information in the HTTP request body. When the user clicks the submit button in a
form that uses the POST method, the browser performs the following:
1. Create an HTTP POST request using the URL from the form's attribute.
2. Create a query string from the form data. Ex:
3. Place the query string in the HTTP request message body, and send the request.
4. Display or update the webpage using the HTTP response received from the server.
The left side of the figure below shows a webpage opened in Chrome. The Dev Tools show the
page's form, which is POSTing to a zyBooks URL. The user entered her name Sarah Connor before
pressing Submit. On the right, the user has pressed Submit, and the DevTools show the details of
the HTTP request. The Payload tab shows the query string created from the form data.

If a form field contains binary data such as an image, the normal format of the query string is not
sufficient to encode the binary data. To accommodate binary data, a POST request can be split into
multiple parts. The element's enctype attribute value "multipart/form-data" indicates the
web browser should split a POST request into multiple parts, where each input field is sent as a
separate part of the HTTP request message. I PARTICIPATION I . . ACTIVITY 4.3.5: Using the POST method to submit form data to a server.

Escaping form data
The&,?, and = characters have special meaning in a query string. If a user enters
characters like&,?,=, or white space characters like space, newline, or tab, the
characters must be escaped, meaning the characters must be transformed into
other representations. The browser rules for escaping form data are as follows:
• Space - +
• All other reserved characters, newline, and tab %XX where XX is the ASCII
hex value of the character
Ex: If "7 + 2 = ?" is entered into a textbox, the browser escapes the values producing

The web server unescapes the form data to determine what the original values are.

• The name attribute names the widget and sends the widget's value when the widget's form is

• The id attribute is used to give a widget a unique identifier.
• The placeholder attribute specifies text that first appears in a text widget, typically for giving

The HTML below asks for a message to tweet. The text box widget does not use the
attribute because no default tweet message makes sense. The submit button does not use the
attribute because the submit button's value is not needed by the web server.
