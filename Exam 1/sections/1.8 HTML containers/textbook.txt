Containers and parent containers
A container is any element in a web document body that has opening and closing tags. Web
developers typically create many containers as a convenience to assist in organizing and formatting
content. Ex: Containers can be formatted by applying styles to adjust margins, padding, horizontal and
vertical alignment, and other visual presentation attributes.
A parent container is the container in which another element resides.

Block elements
zyBooks
0
0
HTML elements can be categorized as either block or inline. A block element (sometimes called a
block-level element) fills the width of the element's parent container and can contain other block
elements, inline elements, and text. Block elements include <hl>, <table>, and <p>.
Some block elements cannot be contained within certain other block elements when the semantics
are unclear. Ex: The <p> element cannot contain another <p> element.
A block element is typically displayed starting and ending on new lines. Ex: The <ol> element is a
block element, and each ordered list starts on a new line separate from previous and following blocks.
The <div> element is a generic element for creating block containers. Unlike other block elements,
such as <p> and <table>, <div> is the only block element with no semantic meaning.
Note
◄
By default, web browsers do not display container borders. For clarity, the container
borders are visible in the following examples.

An inline element fills the minimum space possible in the element's parent container and can only
contain text or other inline elements. Ex: The <a> element is an inline element that creates a hyperlink
container as big as the link's internal content; a hyperlink does not fill the width or height of the link's
parent paragraph.
The <span> element is a generic inline element. Unlike other inline elements, such as <a> and <em>,
the <span> element has no semantic meaning.
Since <div> and <span> do not have semantic meaning, <div> and <span> are used primarily for
presentation and interaction purposes. Good practice is to use elements like <address>
and <article> that convey semantic meaning when creating containers, and use <div> and <span>
only when no other elements are appropriate.
Example 1.8.2: Span elements with visible containers.
The following HTML breaks up the second paragraph from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address into
sentences using a <span> element for each component. The corresponding image displays
a different background color for each inline container.
<p>
<span>Now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that
nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long
endure. </span>
<span>We are met on a great battle-field of that war. </span>
<span>We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final
resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might
live. </span>
<span>It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. </ span>

The difference between block and inline elements is visible in Chrome's DevTools. In
the screenshot below-left, the mouse hovers over the <p> element in the Dev Tools,
and a rectangle appears around the entire paragraph in the webpage. The rectangle
spans the browser width because <p> is a block element. Below-right, the mouse
hovers over the < span> element, but the rectangle is only as wide as the span's
contents because <span> is an inline element.
