Checkbox
A checkbox is a widget for input elements with the type attribute of "checkbox", which allows
users to check, or select, a value. A checkbox initially appears selected if the checked attribute is
set. Ex: <input type=" checkbox" checked> creates a checked checkbox. The checked
attribute is an example of a boolean attribute. A boolean attribute is an attribute that is true when
present and false when absent. No value must be assigned to a boolean attribute.
For each checkbox selected, the browser sends the checkbox's name and value to the server. If the
value attribute is not specified, the default value of "on" is sent. If a checkbox is not selected, the
browser does not send anything to the server. A common error on the server is failing to record all
checkboxes in the form as the browser doesn't report any values for checkboxes not selected by the
user.
Good practice is to use label elements with checkboxes so the user can click the label to check and
uncheck the associated checkbox. I PARTICIPATION I . . ACTIVITY 4.4.1: Submitting checkboxes to the server. □

Radio button
Expected webpage
B
Tl
A radio button is a widget for input elements with the attribute of "radio", which allows users
to select exactly one value from possibly many values. The web browser groups radio buttons
together with the same attribute, where each possible value in a group has an associated
input. When submitting a form, the browser sends the selected radio button's and
attribute. Ex: If the radio button is
selected, "movie=ET" is sent to the server.
The main difference between a radio button and checkbox is that only one radio button in a group
can be selected, while any number of checkboxes can be selected. I PARTICIPATION I . ACTIVITY 4.4.3: Radio buttons.
Try adding another radio option for the restaurants group with a value of Pizza Hut. Click
the submit button to view the form data sent to server. Then, try adding another set of
radio buttons to match the expected rendered HTML.

Drop-down menu
0
The <select> element creates a drop-down menu (or drop-down list), which allows users to select
one of several predefined values. The <option> element creates a value, or option, the user can
select within a drop-down menu. When the user is not interacting with the menu, the drop-down
menu usually displays the selected option.
The difference between a drop-down menu and a radio button widget is that the drop-down menu
only displays the options when interacting with the user, while a radio button widget always
displays all options.

List box
A list box widget is created by specifying a size with the select element's attribute. Ex:

options, the browser adds a vertical scrollbar so the user can scroll through the
The attribute allows the user to select multiple options. On Windows, the user must
hold down the control (Ctrl) button to select multiple options, and on a Mac, the user must hold
down the command button. Many users are unaware of how to choose multiple options from a list
box, so good practice is to use checkboxes instead.

The element has a attribute that can be set to various values like "button" or
"submit". The "button" type is typically used with JavaScript to perform an action when clicked. The
"submit" type creates a submit button for a form. If the attribute is not specified, different
browsers may choose different default types, so good practice is to always specify the type.

The default look of a form's widgets may differ depending on the browser and

Password field
A password field is a widget for input elements with the attribute of "password", which allows
users to enter a password without the password contents being displayed on-screen. Web
browsers usually provide facilities to remember passwords at various websites to help users.
Forms that submit passwords or any sensitive data should always submit with URLs that use
HTTPS. Form data submitted with HTTP are not encrypted, but HTTPS encrypts form data.
