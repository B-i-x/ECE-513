The <img> element is a void element that displays an image in a webpage. The <img> element has
two required attributes:
• The src attribute specifies the URL of the image file to display.
• The alt attribute provides a text description to use as an alternative to displaying the image.
Ex:<img src="https://example.com/family.jpg" alt="Smith family reunion">
displays the image family.jpg, but the text "Smith family reunion" displays if the image cannot be
displayed.

1. The <img> element adds an image to the webpage. The browser retrieves the image using the
src attribute.
2. The browser displays the text from the alt attribute when the image cannot be loaded. A
person with visual impairments may use assistive technology to read the alt text aloud.
3. The browser displays content following the images.

Image size
zyBooks
The image cannot be loaded from the
specified location.
The alt attribute is required.
The width attribute and height attribute are optional <img> attributes that tell the browser how many
pixels the image should occupy. Ex:
<img src=" logo. png" al t="Logo" width=" 2 00" height=" 100 "> makes the logo.png
image display in a rectangle that is 200 x 100 pixels. If the specified width and height are different
from the image's actual size, the browser will resize the image for display.
An image's aspect ratio is the ratio of the image width to the image height. The aspect ratio is written
as width:height. Ex: An image 500 pixels wide and 250 pixels high has an aspect ratio of 500:250,
which simplifies to 2:1.
If an <img> contains only a width or only a height attribute, the image's aspect ratio is maintained.
If an <img> specifies a width and height different from the image's aspect ratio, the browser will
distort the image to match the specified attribute values.
I PARTICIPATION
ACTIVITY 1.5.4: Image sizing.
The following HTML fragment shows a cat image that is 640 x 424 pixels. Try modifying the
HTML to adjust the image size. Render the webpage after each instruction:
1. Make the image 250 pixels wide. Specify only the width.
2. Make the image 250 pixels high. Specify only the height.
3. Resize the image to have a width of 250 pixels and a height of 250 pixels.
Try experimenting with other combinations of sizes to see how the width and height affect
the display of the image.

Image formats
Web browsers support three popular image formats:
1. The JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) image format is commonly used for digital
photographs.
2. The PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format is commonly used for line art, screenshots,
or images requiring transparency.
3. The G/F (Graphics Interchange Format) image format is commonly used for simple animated
images.
All three formats use data compression to decrease the image file size, which allows the file to be
transferred over the internet quicker. JPEG images use lossy compression, meaning that some of the
original picture information is lost when compressed. A photograph is best saved as a JPEG image
because humans cannot easily perceive the quality loss in a photograph. PNG and GIF images use
lossless compression, meaning no image quality is lost. Lossless compression works best when a
large number of adjacent pixels are the same color.
JPEG and PNG images can display true color (24-bit color), which is approximately 16 million different
colors. GIF images are limited to only 256 colors (8-bit color), but GIF images can display animations,
which are popular on social media.

• The APNG image format by Mozilla adds animation capability to PNG with true
color support.
• The SVG image format is an XML format that describes an image as a series of
shapes and lines.
• The WebP image format by Google supports true color, transparency, and
animation.
• The AVIF image format supports transparency, lossy or lossless compression,
and higher compression rates.

A favicon is a small icon that identifies a website and typically displays in a browser
tab. A favicon can be any image format (JPEG, PNG, GIF) and any size. PNG is a
popular favicon format because a PNG can have transparent pixels.
