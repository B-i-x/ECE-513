Anchor element
The <a> element, or anchor element, defines a hyperlink in a webpage. A hyper/ink, or link, specifies
where other information is located and what action the web browser should perform when a user
clicks the hyperlink. A hyperlink action may tell the web browser to go to another webpage, to go to a
location in the same webpage, to download a file, or to send an email.
The href attribute specifies the hyperlink's URL. Ex:
<a href="https: / /wikipedia. org/">Wikipedia</ a> displays the hyperlink WikiQedia and
causes the browser to request the URL https://wikipedia.org/ when the hyperlink is clicked. Other URL
schemes may cause the browser to take different actions. Ex: The URL mailto:mary@gmail.com uses
the mail to scheme that directs the browser to start an email program and address an email to
mary@gmail.com. I PARTICIPATION

Absolute and relative URLs
When a webpage links to web resources on the same website, a relative URL may be specified in the
href attribute instead of an absolute URL.
• An absolute URL is a complete URL. Ex:
<a href="http://example.com/test. html ">test</ a> is a hyperlink using the
absolute URL http://example.com/test.html.
https://leam.zybooks.com/zybook/ARIZONAECE413SalehiF all2024/chapter/1 /print 61/94
10/12/24, 1 :35 PM zyBooks
• A relative URL specifies the relative path to the web resource with no scheme or hostname. Ex:
<a href="test. html " >test</ a> uses the relative URL test.html to refer to an HTML
document on the same website and with the same path as the current HTML document.
A relative URL may use two periods followed by a forward slash ( .. /) in front of a filename to indicate
the file is one directory above the current HTML document. Ex: The relative URL .. /test. html
indicates test.html is in the directory above the HTML document containing the link. I PARTICIPATION

1. A website is organized into 4 HTML files. football.html and geocaching.html are located in the
hobbies directory.
2. index.html contains a hyperlink with a relative URL to family.html since family.html is on the
same website as index.html.
3. Hyperlinks to football.html and geocaching.html use relative URLs that start with "hobbies/"
because both files are in the hobbies directory.
4. football.html uses a relative URL to link to geocaching.html, which is in the same directory as
football.html.
5. football.html uses " .. " in the relative URL to link to index.html, because " .. " refers to the directory
that is one level up from football.html, the mywebsite directory.

A URL can point to a section, or fragment, of a document by adding a hash tag(#) and a fragment
identifier at the end of the URL. Ex:
https : //en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Computer science#History refers to the "History"
section of the "Computer_science" page on Wikipedia.
Adding the id attribute to any element creates a fragment identifier, permitting URLs to link directly to
the id's location in the document. Several rules exist for an id value:
• May be composed of any characters except whitespace characters. Ex: "history 123" is invalid
because of the space.
• Cannot start with a number. Ex: "3section" is invalid.
• Is case sensitive. Ex: "History" and "history" are different ids.
• Must be unique in the document. Ex: Two elements both using "history" is invalid.
Good practice is to choose id values that start with a letter and are composed of only letters, digits,
dashes (-), and underscores (_). Ex: "history7 23-late".
The HTML in the figure below creates two section links to the <section> elements with fragment
identifiers "Ch1" and "Ch2".

The following HTML contains a hyperlink to the Wikipedia page about Abraham Lincoln. Try
adding a document fragment identifier to the hyperlink to point to information on Abraham
Lincoln's legacy, which is in the section named "Legacy". Each Wikipedia section has a unique
fragment identifier to which a hyperlink can link. Note that the only way to discern whether
the hyperlink is correct requires clicking the hyperlink to examine where the hyperlink leads.

An anchor element's target attribute indicates how the browser should display the link when clicked.
• The self attribute value is the default and indicates the browser will open the link in the same
tab or window.
• The_ blank attribute value indicates the browser will open the link in a new tab or window.
