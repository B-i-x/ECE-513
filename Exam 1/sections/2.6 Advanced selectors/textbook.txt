Universal selector
The universal selector, specified using an asterisk character ( ), matches a// elements in the
webpage. The universal selector is implied when an element name is not specified. Ex: The CSS
selectors and match exactly the same elements, where the universal
selector is implied in and explicit in
Multiple selector
The multiple selector, specified using a comma ( ) to separate selectors, matches all listed
elements to apply a style rule. Ex: The figure below shows two CSS examples that apply the same
styles to and elements. The CSS on the left unnecessarily duplicates the styling
declarations for and elements, whereas the CSS on the right uses a single style
declaration using a multiple selector.

Child selector
The child selector, specified using a greater than character ( ) between two selectors, matches any
elements where the second element is a direct child of the first element. The child selector is
similar to the descendant selector (space between selectors), but the matching child element in the
child selector must be a direct child of the matching parent element.

Sibling selectors
Expected webpage

o o • Sibling elements are elements that share the same parent element. The general sibling selector,
specified using a tilde character ( ~) between two selectors, matches the second element if the
second element occurs after the first element and both elements are siblings. Any number of other
elements can be placed between two general sibling elements. In the example below, the heading
and the paragraphs are children of the element. Consequently, the two paragraphs are

The adjacent sibling selector, specified using a plus character ( ) between two selectors, matches
an element that immediately follows another element, where both elements have the same parent.
Ex: The adjacent selector in the figure below matches the first paragraph immediately
following the heading element, where both the paragraph and heading share the same parent
element.

Attribute selector
The attribute selector, specified with an attribute name and optional value comparison enclosed in
square brackets ( and ), matches elements with the specified attribute or the specified attribute
and value. Ex: selector matches anchor elements with a attribute specified.
The attribute selector can be more specific by matching elements with attributes having a specific
value. Ex: attribute selector matches anchor elements with a target
