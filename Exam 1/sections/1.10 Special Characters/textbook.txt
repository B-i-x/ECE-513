Entities
An entity is a mechanism for writing special characters or symbols in HTML, such as mathematical
symbols, characters in most languages, and many other symbols. Many HTML entities can be
specified by name. However, some entities do not have a name and can instead be specified using a
decimal or hexadecimal number as shown in the table below.

Emoji
zyBooks
Emoji characters can be displayed in a webpage with a decimal or hexadecimal entity.
Ex: The happy face emoji, @, can be displayed with &#128512; or &#x1F600 ; . Since
emoji are characters, not images, emoji characters can also be copied and pasted into
any HTML document. Ex: <p> ()<Ip>.

The< and & characters can be displayed using entities. The< character normally marks the beginning
of a tag, so & 1 t; is used to display the < character when < is not part of a tag. The & character marks
the beginning of an entity name, so &amp; is used to display the & character when & does not start an
entity name.
If the browser detects that < is being used without a tag or if & is being used without an entity, the
browser will likely display the< or & characters. Ex: The HTML 2 < 3 & 4 will usually display
2 < 3 & 4 without using entities. Good practice is to use &l t; and &amp; instead of relying on the
browsertodeterminetheHTMLauthor'sintention. Ex: 2 &lt; 3 &amp; 4.
