Modern browsers provide a console that allows the JavaScript code to produce informational and
debugging output for the web developer, which does not affect the functionality or presentation of
the webpage. By default, the console is not visible. The console is viewable in Chrome by pressing
Ctrl+Shift+J in Windows/Linux or Cmd+Opt+J on a Mac.
When a syntax error is present in JavaScript code or a run-time error occurs, the error is only made
visible in the console. The figure below shows the syntax error created when the developer
accidentally typed with a capital "D". The console appears underneath the
webpage. Good practice is to leave the console open while writing and testing JavaScript code.

The browser provides a object with a defined set of methods, or API, that the c onsoH
object supports. An AP/ (Application Programming Interface) is a specification of the methods and
objects that defines how a programmer should interact with software components. The console
API includes the following methods:
• console.log() displays informational data to the console.
• console.warn() displays warnings to the console. The browser usually has a special indicator
to differentiate a warning from the standard log message. Ex: A yellow warning box.

• console.error() displays errors to the console. The browser usually has a special indicator to
differentiate an error from a warning or the standard log message. Ex: A red error box.
• console.dir() displays a JavaScript object to the console. The browser usually supports a
method for compactly representing the object. Ex: A hierarchical tree representation allowing
a developer to expand and collapse the object contents.
Figure 4.6.2: console.log() output example.
When the web browser console is open, both the webpage and the console are
simultaneously visible.

Loading JavaScript from an external file

Including JavaScript directly within an HTML file is common practice when using small amounts of
JavaScript. However, writing JavaScript directly within the document may lead to problems as a
webpage or website gets larger.

Good practice is to use elements to load JavaScript from an external file rather than
writing the JavaScript directly within the HTML file. The element's attribute specifies
a JavaScript file to load.
Example 4.6.1: Loading JavaScript from an external file.

A common error when loading an external JavaScript file is to forget the closing

Although the

The element's async attribute allows the browser to process the webpage concurrently
with loading and processing the JavaScript.
The element's defer attribute allows the browser to load the webpage concurrently with
loading the JavaScript, but the JavaScript is not processed until the webpage is completely loaded.

Step 1:
Index.html code snippet is displayed coming from the web server when the web browser
requests the code. The line
" <script src="flle.js" defer></ script>" is highlighted. The web browser then makes a request to
the web server for the flle.jsm but keeps on going through the HTML code without waiting for the
requested file to load. The code" <p>A piece of text.</p>" is then highlighted and the text "A piece

Step 2:
The code" <img src="dog.jpg" alt="dog">" is then highlighted and the web browser makes a
request to the web server for the dog.jpg file. At the same time, the web server returned the flle .js
file.
Step 3:
The web browser now displays the text "dog .jpg". The web browser does not process the flle.js
due to the defer attribute so the web browser continues to process the HTML. The dog image is
displayed on the web browser. The web browser finishes reading the HTML file, highlighting the
line "<p>Some more text.</ p>". The text "Some more text." appears on the web browser window,
below the dog image.
Step 4:
After the web browser has finished processing the HTML file, the web browser then goes to
process the flle.js file. An alert window is displayed on the web browser with the text "Please
enter to continue.".
Step 5:
Once the user presses enter, the web browser finishes reading the Javascript file, and the alert
window disappears.

1. Web browser reads index.html. <script> tag's defer attribute causes browser to continue
reading HTML without waiting for JavaScript file to load.
2. Web server responds with the JavaScript file while the browser requests the image file.
3. Web browser does not immediately process the JavaScript file due to the defer attribute.
Instead, the browser continues to process the HTML.
4. After reading the HTML file, the web browser reads and executes the JavaScript file.

Miniflcation and obfuscation
To reduce the amount of JavaScript that must be downloaded from a web server,
developers often minify a website's JavaScript. Minification or minimization is the
process of removing unnecessary characters (like whitespace and comments) from
JavaScript code so the code executes the same but with fewer characters.
Miniflcation software may also rename identifiers into shorter ones to reduce space.
Ex: let t o t a lReturns = lo; may be converted into I._. U .J.. V / -
Minified JavaScript is typically stored in a file with a ".min.js" file extension. An
example of minified code from the Bootstrag groject is shown below.

A JavaScript obfuscator is software that converts JavaScript into an unreadable
form that is very difficult to convert back into readable JavaScript. Developers
obfuscate a website's JavaScript to prevent the code from being read or re-purposed
by others. Obfuscated code may also be minified and appear in a ".min.js" file.
