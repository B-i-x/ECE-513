Flexbox container and items
The Flexible Box or flexbox is a CSS layout mode that provides an efficient way to lay out elements
in a container so the elements behave predictably when the container is resized or viewed on
different screen sizes.
A flex container is an element that has the CSS property display set to flex to create a blocklevel
flex container or inline-f lex to create an inline flex container. Ex:
<div style=" display: flex" >. Flex containers hold flex items. A flex item is a child element
of a flex container that is positioned and sized according to various CSS flexbox properties. I PARTICIPATION I 2.7.1 : Flexbox example renders three div elements on the same
ACTIVITY row.
<div i d="container">
<div>A</ div>
<div>B</ div>
<div>C</ div>
</ div>

Animation content:
Two blocks of code are displayed, the first in HTML:
<div id="container">
<div>A</div>
<div>B</div>
<div>C</div>
</div>,
the second in CSS:
/* flex container*/
#container {

display: flex;
border: 1 px green solid;
padding: 5px;
/* flex items*/
#container> div {
padding: 1 Opx;
border: 1 px blue solid;
}
A screen is displayed below. The first scene shows A, B, and C vertically aligned on the left
without CSS. Next the flex container block is highlighted and A, B, and C display left-aligned in a
row. Lastly the flex items block is highlighted and A, B, and Care formatted.
Animation captions:
1. Without any CSS, the A, B, and C div elements display vertically, each filling the browser
width .
2. Setting the CSS display property to "flex" makes the outer div the flex container. The flex
items now display on the same row.
3. The flex items have padding and blue borders.

• The flex-direction property defines the direction of flex items within the container using
values:
(default)
A C

• The gap property defines the space between flex items. Ex:
between all items.

I PARTICIPATION I . . ACTIVITY 2.7.3: Flex container properties for photos.
The webpage below uses a flexbox to display three photos with captions.
Make the following CSS modifications to the flex container. After each modification,
render the webpage to verify the modification works properly.
1. Add a gap property to the flex container to put a 20px gap between the photos.
2. Add a flex-direction property to the flex container to display the photos in
reverse.
3. Add a justify-content property to the flex container to display the photos
centered in the browser window.

• The flex-basis property sets the initial length of a flex item. The values can be (the
default), a percentage, or a length unit. The default value makes the flex item the same
initial length as the content.
• The flex-grow property sets a proportion that determines how much of the available
container space should be assigned to the item. The default is 0, meaning the size should be
based on the item's content.
• The flex-shrink property sets a proportion that determines the item's minimum size. The
default is 1, meaning the size should shrink at the same rate as other items when the
container width shrinks. A value of O means the item should not change sizes when the
container width shrinks.

Next three code blocks of CSS are shown. The first block shows the following:
nav ul {
}
display: flex;
list-style-type: none;
padding: O;
The second:
nav Ii {
}
flex-grow: 1;
background-color: gold;
text-align: center;
And the third:
nav Ii {
}
flex-basis: 1 OOpx;
flex-shrink: O;
background-color: gold;
text-align: center;
Below each CSS code block there is a screen displaying the output. The first shows Home,
Product, and About in a row across the top. The second first shows the three nav links leftaligned
in a row when flex-grow is 0, then portions the nav links evenly when flex-grow is 1. The
third box shows the three nav links changing container size when the browser is resized when
flex-shrink is 0, then flex-shrink is changed to 1, preventing the containers from resizing.
Animation captions:
1. A website's navigation links are displayed in an unordered list.
2. Making the ul element a flex container places the nav links on the same row.
3. By default, the Ii elements have flex-basis:auto and flex-grow:O, so Ii elements are only as
wide as the item's content.
4. Changing flex-grow from the default Oto 1 gives all Ii elements the same proportion. The
elements fill the flex container.
5. Replacing "flex-grow:1" with "flex-basis:1 OOpx" makes each Ii element 1 OOpx wide.
6. Resizing the browser changes the container size. When the container shrinks, the Ii
elements shrink to fill the available space.
7. Changing flex-shrink from the default 1 to O prevents the Ii elements from shrinking when
the browser is resized .

In the CSS flex property, the 0 controls flex-grow, the 1 controls flex-shrink, and the percentage

footer spanning the width at the bottom of body, and between the two is <nav> occupying 20% of

remaining 20% of body on the right side.
Animation captions:
1. <header> and <footer> span the entire width of <body>, but the <div> is a flex container that
displays the flex items on the same row.
2. <nav>, <main>, and <aside> all have flex-grow= 0, so all three flex items' width should be
based on each item's content.
3. <nav>, <main>, and <aside> all have flex-shrink= 1, so all three flex items shrink at the same
rate when the browser is resized.
4. <nav> occupies 20% of the row, <main> occupies 60%, and <aside> occupies 20%. 20% +

I PARTICIPATION I . ACTIVITY 2.7.9: Flexbox practice.
The webpage displays three years of Grammy Award nominations for Album of the Year.
Each year's nomination is placed in a <section>
element.
Alter the webpage to display the three sections in a single row:
1. Add a single <div> element that surrounds all three sections.
2. Add the proper CSS so the <div> becomes a flex container and displays each
section on a single row.
3. Add a flex property to the section rule that sets flex-grow to 0, flex-shrink to 1,
and flex-basis to 250px.
4. Add a flex-wrap property that makes the sections wrap to the next row when the
browser is resized.
After adding the HTML and CSS above, render the webpage. Resize the rendered
webpage's window and verify that the sections wrap to the next row when the window
isn't wide enough to display the sections side-by-side.
