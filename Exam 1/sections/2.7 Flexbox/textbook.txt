o So far this year, 7 4 rattlesnake bites to humans have been reported to the Arizona
Poison and Drug Information Center. Based at the University of Arizona College of
Pharmacy, the center serves the entire state of Arizona with the exception of Maricopa
County, providing free and confidential poison and medication information to callers
around the clock.
o Specialists answering the phones at the center regularly receive calls from Arizonans of
all ages who don't realize they were bitten by a rattler. The poison center urges anyone
who feels a mysterious sting, pinch or bite while outdoors to immediately call the center
at 800-222-1222.
o "We will ask a few questions that will help you either identify possible snakebite or
eliminate it," said Keith Boesen, director of the Arizona Poison and Drug Information
Center. "With snakebite, the sooner the medical treatment, the better the outcome, so
calling us right away can make a very big difference for the victims and the medical
teams treating them."
o The center advises anyone who might come cross paths with rattlesnakes to be aware
of these five things:
• An ordered list with the following item contents (in order):
•
o Baby rattlesnakes range in length from 6 to 12 inches and are easily camouflaged by
brush and grass.
o Baby rattlesnakes are rattleless until they first shed their skins, so there will be no
infamous "chica-chica" sound before they strike.
o Despite their impish size, baby snakes have enough venom to be very dangerous if they
bite a human.
o Adult rattlesnakes do not always rattle an audible warning before or while they are
biting.
o It's a good idea to call the poison center if you notice an unidentified small cut or
wound, even if you feel no pain. With the lack of telltale rattle warning, people can be
bitten without knowing what has happened until they notice their symptoms and
attribute them to a snakebite.
