1.1 IP addresses, domain names, and URLs
IP addresses
A computer communicates with another computer on the internet by sending packets back and forth.
An internet packet contains To and From IP addresses, the information to communicate, and other
configuration information.
An IP address (short for Internet Protocol address) is a computer's unique address on the internet
(like a house's unique address in the world), usually represented numerically like 198.57 .100.7. A
typical IP address is 32 bits, divided into four 8-bit groups, each group often written as a decimal
number. I PARTICIPATION
ACTIVITY 1 .1 .1: IP addresses.

/ I \ " 11000110 00110011 01100100 00000111
0 = 00000000
255 = 11111111
The following IP address is displayed: 198.57 .100.7. For each section of the IP address, the
corresponding 8 bits value is displayed. The 198 is represented with the 8 bits 71000710, 57 is
007 1 001 1, 100 is 07 100100, and 7 is 000007 11 .
Animation captions:
1. An IP address is usually written as four numbers separated by dots.
2. Each number represents 8 bits of the IP address, for a total of 32 bits.
3. The smallest possible number in an IP address is 0, and the largest is 255.

The original Internet Protocol, known as /Pv4, has 32-bit addresses. 32 bits can represent 232 or about
4 billion unique addresses, originally believed to be more than enough, but 4 billion is no longer
enough. A new version of the Internet Protocol, /Pv6, uses 128-bit addresses, capable of representing
2128 addresses. The number 2128 is 3.4 x 1038 or
340,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, which is hopefully enough for quite a while.
IPv4 and IPv6 currently co-exist and likely will for a long time. I PARTICIPATION

Domain names and DNS

Some websites can be directly reached using the computer system's IP address. Ex: Google could say
"Go to 216.58.193.206 to search the internet." But those numbers are hard to remember, and IP
addresses can change, so domain names are commonly used. A domain name is a name for an IP
address, such as the name wikipedia.org for the IP address 198.35.26.96; the name is easier to
remember and type. Capitalization doesn't matter: Wikipedia.org, wikipedia.org, and WIKIPEDIA.ORG
are treated the same.
When a computer sends a packet using a domain name over the internet, the first step is to contact a
DNS server to convert the domain name to an IP address. DNS is short for Domain Name System.
Thirteen main DNS servers (called root servers) exist in the world, and a computer's operating system
or an ISP keeps a reference to the root servers' IP addresses. Ex: 198.41 .0.4 (run by Verisign),
192.228.79.201 (run by USC), 199.7.91 .13 (run by Univ. of Maryland), and 192.203.230.10 (run by
NASA). The first step of sending an internet packet to a domain name is thus to lookup the IP address
via a DNS server.

Access, Data:. Then another packet is sent to a DNS server to get the IP address for cnn.com. This
packet retrieves 157.166.226.25 under Data: and sends it to the original packet. Now the original
packet has the IP address for cnn.com, which is 157.166.226.25.

1. A computer wants to send a packet to cnn.com.
2. First, a packet is sent to a DNS server to lookup the IP address for cnn.com.
3. The packet contains the destination address. The computer can now communicate with CNN.
Registering a domain name
Anyone may register an unused domain name with a domain name registrar. Most
registrars charge a yearly fee for keeping the domain registered. Registration
information is made publicly available from ICANN's Whois service.
When a website is hosted with a web hosting company, the company will update the
DNS servers so the website's domain name is associated with the IP address of the
hosted website. The web hosting company may also manage the yearly registration of
the domain name.

Domain name levels
Domain names are hierarchical. A domain name belongs to one of numerous top-level domains (TLD),
such as .com, .net, .org, .edu, and .gov. Also, each country is assigned a unique two-letter country code
top-level domain (ccTLD) like .uk (United Kingdom), .ru (Russia), and .de (Germany). IANA, the
organization that manages TLDs, allows companies and organizations to create customized TLDs, like
.church, .pizza, and .music.

A branch diagram is displayed with each branch explaining the domain name of websites. The
Commercial websites are represented with a .com domain name, Network websites are
represented with a .net domain name, Organization websites are represented with a .org domain
name, Education websites are represented with a .edu domain name, and Government sites are
represented with a .gov domain name.
Animation captions:
1. Internet domain names are divided by top-level domains.
2. The most popular is .com. Most companies have a .com name.
3. Next most popular is .net. Typically for networking/internet-focused companies.
4. Next is .org, traditionally for non-profit organizations.
5. Other well-known top-level domains are .edu for colleges, and .gov for U.S. governments.
Hundreds more exist.
Immediately after a top-level domain comes a second-level domain, such as wikipedia in
wikipedia.org. A second-level domain is commonly an organization's name as in Stanford.edu, or
indicates the purpose of a website as in DoPython.org. Third-level and further level domains refer to
sub-computer systems local to an organization, as in cs.stanford.edu where the cs is for Stanford's
Computer Science department. A common third-or-deeper-level domain is www, short for World Wide
Web, usually referring to an organization's web server. Many organizations use www optionally, so
stanford.edu by default goes to www.stanford.edu.

The top-down structure of a domain name is, somewhat counterintuitively, from rightto-
left rather than left-to-right. Thus, cs.stanford.edu has a top-level domain of .edu,
second-level stanford, and third-level cs. Common scams use this counterintuitive rightto-
left feature to trick people into thinking a site belongs to a particular company Ex:
bankofamerica.xxyz.com might trick a person into thinking the domain name is for Bank
of America.
URLs
►
Domain names are most commonly seen in URLs. A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the location
of a web resource on the web, such as http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/faqs.htm. A web resource is any
retrievable item, like an HTML file, image, video, CSS stylesheet, etc.
A URL is composed of several parts:
• Scheme - Characters at the beginning of a URL followed by a colon":" or a colon and double
slashes"://". Common URL schemes include http, https, mail to, and file . Ex: In
https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol, the scheme is "https".
• Hostname - The complete domain name following the scheme in a URL. Ex: In
https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol, the hostname is "www.cdc.gov".
• Path - The characters to the right of the hostname in a URL. Ex: In https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol,
the path is "/alcohol".
• Query string - Optional characters to the right of the question mark(?) in a URL that provide data
for the web server. In https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu7XCEMdSHg, the characters after
the? tells You Tube's server to play a video having code uu7XCEMdSHg.
• Fragment - Optional characters at the end of a URL that start with a hash character(#) and refer
to a certain location within a webpage. In https://en .wikipedia .org/wiki/URL#History, the
fragment "#History" refers to the webpage's History section.

Webpage errors
zyBooks
If a domain name is not found by a DNS server (usually because the domain name is not registered), a
page is displayed indicating such, as in "Sorry, the website www.xyz.blahblahblah cannot be found."
A domain name may be found (so a valid IP address exists for that name) but the web server may not
respond, resulting in a message like 'The website is not responding" or "Could not reach the website".
Such non-response could be due to the web server being turned off or undergoing maintenance, or
due to an essential router malfunctioning, for example.
If a web server is reached but the specific requested page isn't found, the server returns a 404 status
code, which is a code number for page not found. Various other status codes exist. Many web servers
return a page that includes the number "404".

12/94
HTML defines over 130 elements. An element is a single HTML structure. Elements are represented
with HTML tags.
An HTML tag is a markup instruction identified by<, the tag name, and>.
• An opening tag indicates the element's starting point in the document.
• A closing tag indicates the element's ending point in the document.
Ex: <strong>Hello</ strong> causes Hello to appear in a strong weighted font; <strong> is the
opening tag,</ strong> is the closing tag, and everything from the opening tag to the closing tag is
the element. While tag names can be uppercase or lowercase, good practice is to use lowercase letters
for the tag names, as in <strong>Hello</ strong> rather than <Strong>Hello</ Strong>
Some elements, like <br> and <img>, do not have a closing tag. A void element is an element that
only needs an opening tag.

The HTML Living Standard, produced by WHATWG, defines the minimal parts of an HTML document:
1. The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration instructs the web browser about what type of document
follows.
2. The <html> element encloses everything but the<! DOCTYPE html> declaration.
<html lang="en "> indicates that the document's language is English.
3. The <head> element contains the document title, document metadata, and various other
elements that are typically not displayed in the webpage.
4. The <meta> element specifies metadata, which is data that describes the document's data.
<meta charset="UTF-8 "> describes how characters are represented in the HTML
document. Additional <meta> tags may be used to indicate when the document was saved,
who the author is, etc.
5. The <title> element specifies the document's name. The title is usually displayed in the browser's
titlebar, is used by search engines, and is used for bookmarking.
6. The <body> element encloses all elements and content to be rendered in the browser.
The opening <html> tag uses an attribute to indicate the webpage's language, and <meta> uses an
attribute to indicate the character set. An element attribute provides additional information about the
element and is included only in the opening tag. An attribute has a name and a value, specified using
the form: name="value". Ex: <meta charset="UTF-8 "> has an attribute named char set with
value "UTF-8".

3. The <head> opening and closing tags enclose the <meta> and <title> elements.
4. The <body> opening and closing tags enclose the document's contents. The browser displays
the document body in the webpage.
Notes
◄
Omitting the DOCTYPE from an HTML document or placing any characters before the
DOCTYPE causes the web browser to render the document in quirks mode. Quirks
mode is a browser rendering mode that renders a webpage using non-standard layout
rules emulating older web browsers. A webpage with the DOCTYPE is rendered using
standards mode, which uses the HTML Living Standard.
The character set <meta> tag may be omitted if the webpage is served from a web
server that indicates the character encoding in the HTTP Content-Type header. UTF-
8 is a common character encoding that describes characters used by most of the
world's languages. UTF-8 even includes fictional languages (e.g., Klingon, Elvish) and
emoji (e.g., @, +-).
The <head> element is optional but is included anyway in most webpages.

Notepad++. and Visual Studio Code.
2. Create a new file.
3. Enter the HTML from the animation above into the file.
4. Save the file to your computer's hard drive as hello.html. The file extension
. html is necessary for your browser to know the text file contains HTML.
5. Using Chrome or your favorite web browser, open hello.html by pressing Ctrl+O

A user on a desktop/laptop computer can instruct a browser to show a webpage's HTML. A web
search for "View webpage HTML in Chrome" (or another browser) yields instructions. Ex: In Chrome,
right-clicking (Windows) or Ctrl-clicking (Mac) and choosing "View page source" from the menu shows
the webpage's HTML. A quicker method is to use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+U (Windows) or
~+Option+U (Mac). Most webpages use complex HTML with CSS and JavaScript, so the HTML can
be hard to read.

HTML validator
Some elements that were used in earlier versions of HTML are now deprecated in the HTML Living
Standard. A deprecated feature is part of a language that is officially discouraged because newer or
better features exist, or because the deprecated feature is no longer considered safe. Ex: The
<center> element is an officially deprecated element that should no longer be used.
Browsers handle improperly structured HTML and deprecated elements differently and unpredictably.
The only way to have predictable browser behavior is to use valid HTML. An HTML validator checks
that an HTML document conforms to the standard. Good practice is to use tools like the W3C MarkuQ
Validator to check document conformance.

1.3 Basic HTML elements
Paragraphs
The <p> element creates a paragraph in an HTML document. A paragraph is enclosed in HTML by the
<p> opening and </p> closing tags. Browsers visually separate paragraphs from other text with
spacing above and below.
A common error is forgetting the closing <Ip> tag, or trying to put a paragraph inside of another
paragraph. The web browser might render nested <p> tags visually correct, but an HTML validator will
generate an error.

Whitespace and line breaks
zyBooks
A whitespace character is an unprinted character such as the spaces between words and lines of text.
Browsers treat all sequences of whitespace as a single space between non-whitespace characters.
Ex: The three spaces in the HTML "hello there" will be displayed with a single space "hello there".
Whitespace characters include spaces, tabs, and newlines. So, a browser treats multiple lines of text
as a single space.
The <br> element creates a line break in a paragraph, such that the content after the line break
appears on a new line. The <br> element is a void element, so only the opening tag is needed. Good
practice is to use <br> when the line break is essential to the content, such as lines in a poem or
mailing address, and not just to add spacing for formatting a webpage. CSS, discussed elsewhere,
should be used for formatting a webpage.

Sections and headings
zyBooks
A section is a collection of related content created with a <section> element. Many documents can be
organized into sections, with each section being wrapped in a <section> element. Ex: A scholarly
article's abstract, introduction, main content, and references can each be wrapped in a <section>
element.
A heading provides a title for each section. Headings are bold by default and are visually separated
from the other text by extra spacing. Heading elements exist for the first six levels of sections: <h1>,
<h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>. Headings are helpful to users who skim through a webpage, to
assistive technologies like screen readers, and to search engines.
Good practice is to label each section with a heading and to select a heading element that matches the
document's hierarchical structure. A common error is to choose a heading element based on the
desired font size.

Text formatting
zyBooks
A number of HTML elements cause the enclosed text to render in a different font in the browser:
0
0
• The <em> element indicates emphasized text, such as text having an emphasized pronunciation
when spoken, and is italicized by default.
• The <strong> element indicates text that has strong importance, and is bolded by default.
• The <cite> element denotes a title, such as a book or song title, and is italicized by default. Ex:
<cite>Spaceballs</cite> is a parody of the <cite>Star Wars</cite> tril
yields: Spaceballs is a parody of the Star Wars trilogy.
• The <mark> element denotes important content that should be semantically highlighted and is
rendered with a yellow background by default. Ex:
<mark>Highlight</mark> what is important. yields: Highlight what is important.
• The <b> element indicates text that needs attention, like key words in a document abstract or
product names in a review, and renders the text in bold. Ex: Mix the flour and oil together.
• The <i> element indicates text in an alternative voice, such as a word or phrase in a foreign
language, and is rendered using italics. Ex: Dashi is a stock used in Japanese cooking.
• The <u> element denotes text that should appear differently from normal text, such as
misspelled words, and is underlined by default. Ex: Misspelled is often misspelled as mispelled.
Note
◄
Historically, in HTML4, the <b>, <i>, and <u> elements were used to render text and
did not have meaning, or semantics. Good practice is to avoid formatting elements
whenever possible, and instead use elements to indicate meaning. Ex: The <i> element
can be used to emphasize text, but the <em> element should be used to convey
emphasis.

The <img> element is a void element that displays an image in a webpage. The <img> element has
two required attributes:
• The src attribute specifies the URL of the image file to display.
• The alt attribute provides a text description to use as an alternative to displaying the image.
Ex:<img src="https://example.com/family.jpg" alt="Smith family reunion">

Image size
zyBooks
The image cannot be loaded from the
specified location.
The alt attribute is required.
The width attribute and height attribute are optional <img> attributes that tell the browser how many
pixels the image should occupy. Ex:
<img src=" logo. png" al t="Logo" width=" 2 00" height=" 100 "> makes the logo.png
image display in a rectangle that is 200 x 100 pixels. If the specified width and height are different
from the image's actual size, the browser will resize the image for display.
An image's aspect ratio is the ratio of the image width to the image height. The aspect ratio is written
as width:height. Ex: An image 500 pixels wide and 250 pixels high has an aspect ratio of 500:250,
which simplifies to 2:1.
If an <img> contains only a width or only a height attribute, the image's aspect ratio is maintained.
If an <img> specifies a width and height different from the image's aspect ratio, the browser will
distort the image to match the specified attribute values.

Image formats
Web browsers support three popular image formats:
1. The JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) image format is commonly used for digital
photographs.
2. The PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format is commonly used for line art, screenshots,
or images requiring transparency.
3. The G/F (Graphics Interchange Format) image format is commonly used for simple animated
images.
All three formats use data compression to decrease the image file size, which allows the file to be
transferred over the internet quicker. JPEG images use lossy compression, meaning that some of the
original picture information is lost when compressed. A photograph is best saved as a JPEG image
because humans cannot easily perceive the quality loss in a photograph. PNG and GIF images use
lossless compression, meaning no image quality is lost. Lossless compression works best when a
large number of adjacent pixels are the same color.
JPEG and PNG images can display true color (24-bit color), which is approximately 16 million different
colors. GIF images are limited to only 256 colors (8-bit color), but GIF images can display animations,
which are popular on social media.

color support.
• The SVG image format is an XML format that describes an image as a series of
shapes and lines.
• The WebP image format by Google supports true color, transparency, and
animation.
• The AVIF image format supports transparency, lossy or lossless compression,
and higher compression rates.
