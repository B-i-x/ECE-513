Ordered lists
An ordered list is a sequenced collection of items, usually indented and shown using numbers or
letters, created with the <o/> element. As with an unordered list, each list item is created with an <li>
element. The <ol> element's numbering scheme is specified with the type attribute. The table below
shows the different types available.

1.7 Links
Anchor element
The <a> element, or anchor element, defines a hyperlink in a webpage. A hyper/ink, or link, specifies
where other information is located and what action the web browser should perform when a user
clicks the hyperlink. A hyperlink action may tell the web browser to go to another webpage, to go to a
location in the same webpage, to download a file, or to send an email.
The href attribute specifies the hyperlink's URL. Ex:
<a href="https: / /wikipedia. org/">Wikipedia</ a> displays the hyperlink WikiQedia and
causes the browser to request the URL https://wikipedia.org/ when the hyperlink is clicked. Other URL
schemes may cause the browser to take different actions. Ex: The URL mailto:mary@gmail.com uses
the mail to scheme that directs the browser to start an email program and address an email to
mary@gmail.com. I PARTICIPATION

Absolute and relative URLs
When a webpage links to web resources on the same website, a relative URL may be specified in the
href attribute instead of an absolute URL.
• An absolute URL is a complete URL. Ex:
<a href="http://example.com/test. html ">test</ a> is a hyperlink using the
absolute URL http://example.com/test.html.
• A relative URL specifies the relative path to the web resource with no scheme or hostname. Ex:
<a href="test. html " >test</ a> uses the relative URL test.html to refer to an HTML
document on the same website and with the same path as the current HTML document.
A relative URL may use two periods followed by a forward slash ( .. /) in front of a filename to indicate
the file is one directory above the current HTML document. Ex: The relative URL .. /test. html
indicates test.html is in the directory above the HTML document containing the link. I PARTICIPATION

Section links

A URL can point to a section, or fragment, of a document by adding a hash tag(#) and a fragment
identifier at the end of the URL. Ex:
https : //en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Computer science#History refers to the "History"
section of the "Computer_science" page on Wikipedia.
Adding the id attribute to any element creates a fragment identifier, permitting URLs to link directly to
the id's location in the document. Several rules exist for an id value:
• May be composed of any characters except whitespace characters. Ex: "history 123" is invalid
because of the space.
• Cannot start with a number. Ex: "3section" is invalid.
• Is case sensitive. Ex: "History" and "history" are different ids.
• Must be unique in the document. Ex: Two elements both using "history" is invalid.
Good practice is to choose id values that start with a letter and are composed of only letters, digits,
dashes (-), and underscores (_). Ex: "history7 23-late".
The HTML in the figure below creates two section links to the <section> elements with fragment
identifiers "Ch1" and "Ch2".

Containers and parent containers
A container is any element in a web document body that has opening and closing tags. Web
developers typically create many containers as a convenience to assist in organizing and formatting
content. Ex: Containers can be formatted by applying styles to adjust margins, padding, horizontal and
vertical alignment, and other visual presentation attributes.
A parent container is the container in which another element resides.

Block elements
zyBooks

0
HTML elements can be categorized as either block or inline. A block element (sometimes called a
block-level element) fills the width of the element's parent container and can contain other block
elements, inline elements, and text. Block elements include <hl>, <table>, and <p>.
Some block elements cannot be contained within certain other block elements when the semantics
are unclear. Ex: The <p> element cannot contain another <p> element.
A block element is typically displayed starting and ending on new lines. Ex: The <ol> element is a
block element, and each ordered list starts on a new line separate from previous and following blocks.
The <div> element is a generic element for creating block containers. Unlike other block elements,
such as <p> and <table>, <div> is the only block element with no semantic meaning.
Note
◄
By default, web browsers do not display container borders. For clarity, the container
borders are visible in the following examples.

76/94
An inline element fills the minimum space possible in the element's parent container and can only
contain text or other inline elements. Ex: The <a> element is an inline element that creates a hyperlink
container as big as the link's internal content; a hyperlink does not fill the width or height of the link's
parent paragraph.
The <span> element is a generic inline element. Unlike other inline elements, such as <a> and <em>,
the <span> element has no semantic meaning.
Since <div> and <span> do not have semantic meaning, <div> and <span> are used primarily for
presentation and interaction purposes. Good practice is to use elements like <address>
and <article> that convey semantic meaning when creating containers, and use <div> and <span>
only when no other elements are appropriate.
Example 1.8.2: Span elements with visible containers.
The following HTML breaks up the second paragraph from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address into
sentences using a <span> element for each component. The corresponding image displays
a different background color for each inline container.
<p>
<span>Now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that
nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long
endure. </span>
<span>We are met on a great battle-field of that war. </span>

1.9 Tables
Creating a table
4
A table is an HTML structure created with the <table> element that organizes data into rows and
columns. A cell is a location in the table at a specific row and column.
• The <tr> element creates a table row, which contains all the row's cells.
• The <th> element creates a table cell containing table header information about the data.
Usually, the browser displays table headers centered with a bold font.
• The <td> element creates a table cell containing table data.
A table caption defines a short descriptive text for a table and is created with the <caption> element.
The caption element must immediately follow the opening <table> tag. A web browser typically
renders the table caption centered above the table. I PARTICIPATION

Presidential Nominees
Party Nominee
Democratic Franklin Pierce
Whig Winfield Scott
End of code snippet. The browser displays "Presidential Nominees" with a table underneath and
column headers "Party" and "Nominee" in the first row. The second row is "Democratic" in the first
column and "Franklin Pierce" in the second column. The third row is "Whig" in the first column and
"Winfield Scott" in the second column.
Animation captions:
1. The <table> opening and </table> closing tags create a structure to store the table's contents.
2. The <caption> opening and </caption> closing tags surround the table's caption, which
renders above the table.
3. The <tr> opening and </tr> closing tags create a row inside the table.
4. The <th> opening and </th> closing tags create two header cells in the same row.
5. Two more rows are added to the table. Each row has two data cells, created with <td> opening
and </td> closing tags.
6. Without CSS, the table renders with no borders around the table cells.
Table borders
◄
The tables in this section appear with borders for clarity CSS can be added to a
webpage to display table borders. Ex:
<style>
table , th, td {
border : 2px solid gray;
}
</ style>
CSS, discussed elsewhere, can a/so be used to increase the table's size, add
background images and color, change the cell text alignment, etc.

Closing tags
Web browsers often have to process invalid HTML and attempt to fix errors. However,
the resulting behavior is unpredictable. Because web developers commonly do not write
the closing </tr>, </th>, and <ltd> tags, the Living HTML Standard permits not
writing those closing tags. Good practice is to always use both the opening and closing
tags for the <tr>, <th>, and <td> elements.
Accessible tables
People that use screen readers to hear table content benefit from the proper use of
◄ ►
◄
<th> elements for table headings. Complex or long tables may use the scope attribute
to improve accessibility The scope attribute is commonly assigned "col" or "row" to
indicate if the table header applies to a column or row of data. Ex:
<table>
<caption>Weight Extremes</caption>
<tr>
<th></ th>
<th scope="col" >Lightest</ th>
<th scope="col" >Heaviest</ th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row" >Bird</th>
<td>Bee Hummingbird</td>
<td>Ostrich</ td>
</ tr>
<tr>
<th scope= "row" >Mammal</th>
<td>Pygmy Shrew</ td>
<td>Blue Whale</ td>
</tr>
</ table>
More information about scope is found in "Exploring further".
Spanning multiple columns and rows
►
A single table cell occupies a single row and column by default, but a cell may span multiple columns
or multiple rows using the co/span attribute and rowspan attribute to specify how many columns or
rows to span. The col span and rowspan attributes apply to <td> and <th> elements.

An entity is a mechanism for writing special characters or symbols in HTML, such as mathematical
symbols, characters in most languages, and many other symbols. Many HTML entities can be

decimal or hexadecimal number as shown in the table below.

zyBooks
Emoji characters can be displayed in a webpage with a decimal or hexadecimal entity.
Ex: The happy face emoji, @, can be displayed with &#128512; or &#x1F600 ; . Since
emoji are characters, not images, emoji characters can also be copied and pasted into
any HTML document. Ex: <p> ()<Ip>.
◄
Entities for reserved characters

►
The< and & characters can be displayed using entities. The< character normally marks the beginning
of a tag, so & 1 t; is used to display the < character when < is not part of a tag. The & character marks
the beginning of an entity name, so &amp; is used to display the & character when & does not start an
entity name.
If the browser detects that < is being used without a tag or if & is being used without an entity, the
browser will likely display the< or & characters. Ex: The HTML 2 < 3 & 4 will usually display
2 < 3 & 4 without using entities. Good practice is to use &l t; and &amp; instead of relying on the
browsertodeterminetheHTMLauthor'sintention. Ex: 2 &lt; 3 &amp; 4.
