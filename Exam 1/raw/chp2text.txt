2.1 Using CSS in HTML
Introduction to CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a textual language for describing how a webpage is styled for
visual presentation. Web browsers use CSS to determine how a webpage is rendered on the screen,
printed to paper, or presented via other media. The CSS acronym highlights the two main
characteristics of presenting a webpage: I PARTICIPATION I . ACTIVITY 2.1.1: Understanding the CSS acronym.

Cascading Style Sheet
The process of combining multiple
style rules and resolving conflicting
styles.
Describes the visual presentation of
structured documents.

□
A web developer uses CSS to write a list of rules. A CSS rule consists of a selector followed by a
declaration block between braces ( ).
• A CSS selector specifies the HTML elements to which the specific style rule applies.
• A declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons ( ).
• A CSS styling declaration is a CSS property followed by a colon (·)and the property value.

}

Semicolons are only required to separate rule declarations. A common error is to forget the
separating semicolon when adding a new declaration to a declaration block. Good practice is to place
each declaration on a separate line and to add a semicolon to the end of each declaration block, even
when a semicolon is not required, so that adding the semicolon is not forgotten later when adding
more declarations.

Inheritance and conflict
Every browser has a default stylesheet that specifies styling for each HTML element. Ex: The
default style declarations for elements typically specify a bold-weighted font that is twice the
normal font size. CSS style declarations override the default style declarations.
The style declarations from a parent element cascade down and are applied to any child elements,
a concept called inheritance. Each element inherits the style declarations from the element's
parent. The element's parent inherits style declarations from the parent's parent element, and so on
up to the top-level element.
When two style declarations with identical properties apply to the same element, a conflict occurs.
Two common conflicts include:
1. A parent's style declaration conflicts with a child's style declaration. Ex: The parent element's
text is blue, but a child element's style declaration indicates the color should be green. When a
conflict occurs, the child's declaration overrides the parent's declaration.
2. An embedded or external stylesheet's style declaration conflicts with an inline style. Ex: An
inline style says the element should be blue, but the embedded stylesheet says the element
should be green. When a conflict occurs, an inline style overrides the embedded or external
stylesheet's declaration.
Specificity and !important
The browser uses specificity, a scoring system that resolves more complex CSS
conflicts, to determine what style declarations apply to an element. See the
"Exploring further" section below for more information on CSS specificity
The !important rule may be used on a style declaration to override other declarations
and disregard specificity Ex: { col or: 1 makes the
paragraph red, even if an inline style attempts to make the paragraph green.
Stylesheets that use! important are hard to understand and difficult to maintain,
so good practice is to avoid using ! importa

2.2 Basic selectors
Element, class, and ID selectors
CSS has many ways to specify the selector. Three common selector types are:
1. The element selector matches elements with the specified element names.
Ex: p { color : blue; } selects all p elements.
2. The class selector, specified with a period character followed by the class name, matches
elements that have the specified class name.
Ex: . notice { c o lor: blue; } selects all elements with a class="notice" attribute.
3. The ID selector, specified with a hash character followed by the ID name, matches the
element that has the specified ID.
Ex: #byLine { color: blue; } selects the element with the id="byLine" attribute.
HTML class names allow CSS rules and JavaScript code to modify all HTML elements belonging to
a class. An HTML element's_class attribute_ specifies the classes to which the element belongs,
with each class name separated by a space. Ex: <span class="highlight first" > has two
classes, highlight and first . While HTML elements' IDs are unique, many elements may use
the same HTML class name.

Facts about CSS
According to Wikipedia, CSS was first
proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on
October 10, 1994. [1]
The first W3C CSS Recommendation
(CSS1) was released in 1996.
CSS was selected over competing
stylesheet technologies because CSS
allowed a document's style to be
influenced by multiple stylesheets by
way of "cascading". [1]
Four years passed from when CSS1
was released before any browser fully
supported CSS1. [2]

Pseudo-class selector
The pseudo-class selector, specified with a colon character followed by a pseudo-class name,
matches elements based on user behavior or element metainformation. Example pseudo-class
selectors include:
• :disabled - Element is disabled.
• :hover - Mouse is hovering over the element.
• :empty - Element has no child elements.
• :lang(language) - Element contains text in a specified language.
• :nth-child(n) - Element is the parent element's nth child.
Class selectors and pseudo-class selectors can combine with element names to match more
specific elements. Ex: selects only the anchor element the mouse is hovering over, and
selects only elements that have the class attribute.

child element have a lavender background color.

The color CSS property changes the text color to a specified color value. A color value can be
specified in several ways:
• CSS defines 140 color names. Ex: white, blue, black, gray, forestgreen, magenta.

• An RGB color value specifies a color using the rgb(red, green, blue) function by indicating the
red, green, and blue intensities. Each intensity for red, green, and blue is between O and 255,
where O is the lowest intensity and 255 is the highest.
Ex: is black, is blue, is yellow, and
is white.
• A hexadecimal color specifies a color using the format by indicating the red, green,
and blue intensities. Each intensity for red, green, and blue is between 00 and FF hexadecimal
numbers, where 00 is the lowest intensity and FF is the highest.
Ex: is black, is blue, is yellow, and is white.
• An HSL color value specifies a color using the hsl(hue, saturation, lightness) function by
indicating the hue, saturation, and lightness values. The hue value ranges between O and 360,
and the saturation and lightness values range between 0% and 100%. Ex:
is black, is green, and is dark red.
The HSL color specification method is harder to understand and is not used as frequently as
the RGB and hexadecimal color specification methods.
• The RGB and HSL color values can add an alpha value to allow for transparency. The RGBA
color value specifies a color using the rgba(red, green, blue, alpha) function by indicating the
red, green, blue, and alpha intensities. The HSLA color value specifies a color using the
hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha) function by indicating the hue, saturation, lightness,
and alpha intensities. The intensities have the same ranges as for RGB or HSL color values,
but the alpha intensity is between O and 1. An alpha of O means fully transparent, 1 means
fully opaque, and 0.5 means half transparent.

Background properties
Every element in a webpage has a set of background properties. The web browser first draws the
element's background and then the element's content. If the element's background is not fully
opaque, the element's parent is visible under the element's content. Common background
properties include:
• The background-color property specifies the background color.
• The background-image property specifies a background image.
• The background property is shorthand for setting several of the element's background
properties at the same time.
Background colors are specified using color names, a color function (RGB, RGBA, HSL, HSLA), or
one of the values such as . Background images are specified with the value or
the url('URL) function, where URL indicates the location of the image. By default, the initial
background color is and background image is , which means the element's
parent's background will display underneath the elemenfs content. When a background color and
image are both specified, the background image is rendered on top of the color. I PARTICIPATION I . . ACTIVITY 2.3.3: Styling background color and image.

The <span class="display2">pen</span> is mightier than the sword.
</p>
<p>
All good things come to those who <span class="display2">wait</span>.
</p>
Step 1: The browser displays: "Actions speak louder than words." with a blue background that
spans the entire browser width.
Step 2: After changing the CSS, the blue background shrinks to displaying only behind the
paragraph's words .
Step 3: The browser displays 'The pen is mightier than the sword.", and the word "pen" has a
yellow background.
Step 4: After changing the CSS, the word "pen" moves to the next line, and the yellow background
expands to fill the browser width.
Step 5: The browser displays "All good things come to those who wait.". After changing the CSS,
the word "wait" disappears, and the period slides to the left after "who" and a space.
Animation captions:
1. The p element is a block element, and a block element fills the width of the element's
container.
2. Adding display:inline to the display1 class makes the p element be treated as an inline
element. The blue background now is only as wide as the paragraph contents.
3. The span element is an inline element, so the span's content is shown on the same line as
the surrounding text.
4. Adding display:block to the display2 class make the span be treated as a block element.
The span's content now displays on a separate line.
5. The span's content displays by default, but adding display:none to the display3 class hides
the span's contents.

CSS variables
Many websites have complex stylesheets with repeated values. Ex: The same background color
may be used in numerous places, and changing the background color requires searching and
replacing throughout the stylesheet. CSS variables simplify the process of creating CSS values that
are used repeatedly in a stylesheet.
A CSS variable is a custom CSS property that defines a value. A CSS variable is declared in a CSS
selector that defines the variable's scope. A CSS variable can have global scope by declaring the
variable in the :root selector, which targets the highest DOM element: the element.
A CSS variable is defined with two dashes preceding the variable name. Ex:
A CSS variable is accessed with the var() function. Ex:

2.4 Font and text properties
Font properties
Many CSS properties control the font properties for displaying text. CSS font properties include:
• The font-family property specifies the font family, such as "Times New Roman" or serif.
• The font-size property changes the font size, such as 12 o %, smal 1, or 12px.
• The font-weight property specifies the font weight, such as normal or bold.
• The font-style property changes the text style, such as normal, italic, or oblique.
• The font-variant property specifies the variant of the text, such as normal or small-caps.
• The font property is shorthand for setting several font properties at the same time. Ex:
font: italic 12pt Georgia, serif;
The font-family property contains a list of fonts specified as a family name or a generic family
separated by commas.
• A family name is the name of a specific font, like 'Times New Roman", "Arial", or "Georgia".
Family names containing spaces must be wrapped in quotations marks, while family names
without spaces do not.
• A generic family is a general group of fonts, like serif, sans-serif, cursive, fantasy, or
monospace. Ex: Times New Roman and Georgia are both serif fonts because the fonts

contain serifs, which are small strokes attached to the end of larger strokes on each letter.
The web browser will use the first font listed that is available. Good practice is to start the list with
the intended font and end with a generic family. Ex:

The font size can be specified using a predefined size name, a relative size name, or a number with
an absolute or relative size unit. The predefined size names are
, and , where medium is the default size. The relative size
names are and which change the font size for an element to be smaller or larger
than the font size of the parent element.
An absolute size is a size that is fixed and independent of other CSS sizes. Absolute size units
include:
• - centimeters
• - millimeters
• - inches
• - pixels (7 px = 1 /96in)
• - points (7 pt = 1 /72in)
• - pica (7 pc = 12pt)
A relative size is a size that is relative to another size. Some common relative size units include:
• - Relative to the element's font size. Ex: 2em = 2 x current font size.
• - Relative to the root element's font size. Ex: 1.5rem = 1.5 x element's font size.
• - 1 % of the viewport's width. Ex: 1 0vw = 10% of browser's width.
• - 1 % of the viewport's height. Ex: 5vh = 5% of browser's height.
• - Percentage of the element's font size. Ex: 120% = 20% larger than the current font size.
Most web browsers use a default font size of 16px. However, users who struggle to read 16px
fonts may change the browser's default font size to a larger size. Good practice is to use relative
font sizes, which scale with changes to the default browser font size.

The CSS is commonly used to remove the default
underline from links. The underline helps users quickly identify links, so developers
should use caution when removing link underlines. Relying solely on color to identify
links can be problematic to users that are color blind or insensitive.

2. 5 Box model
Box model components
HTML elements take up space on the webpage. The box model describes the size of each element
as a series of nested boxes. The box model is important to understand when considering design
and layout.
• Content: The innermost box contains the content of the element, such as text and images.
• Padding: The padding box contains the content box and adds a transparent area around the
content.
• Border: The border box contains the padded content and adds an optionally colored area
around the padding.
• Margin: The margin box contains all three boxes and adds a transparent area around the
border.

The CSS properties that control the padding, border, and margin are:
.-
• The padding property specifies the padding thickness. Ex:
padding around the content.
creates a 5 pixel
• The border property specifies the border's thickness, style, and color. Ex:
creates a solid blue border that is 2 pixels thick.
• The margin property specifies the margin thickness. Ex:
margin.
creates a 1 O pixel
The content, padding, margin, and border boxes are rendered according to the following rules:
• The content is displayed with a background according to the element's background color.
• The padding is transparent and will be displayed using the same color as the element's
background.
• The border can be either colored or transparent. If transparent, the border will be displayed
with the same color as the padding.
• The margin is transparent and will be displayed using the background color of the parent
element. I PARTICIPATION

Together the HTML and CSS displays three div elements on a screen. The first element is shown
in a blue box across the top of the screen and has the text "Before". The second is shown under
the first element with a 5 pixel transparent margin that surrounds the 5 pixel black border. Inside
the border there is a 5 pixel padding that surrounds the div content, which has the text "Content".
Both the padding and the div element have the background color blue. The third div element is
displayed under the second div element. The third div is shown as a blue box spanning across the
screen with the text "After".
Animation captions:
1. The box model describes the space each HTML element takes as a box. Each div element
is displayed with a blue background, and each box is highlighted with a light blue outline.
2. Padding surrounds the content element with transparent space, which is displayed using

Margin collapsing and horizontal centering
Vertical margins of two elements can sometimes combine or collapse into a single vertical space.
Horizontal margins never collapse. Ex: Adjoining margins of two vertically stacked block elements
collapse. The resulting margin size equals the top element's bottom margin or the bottom
element's top margin, whichever is larger.
Example 2.5.5: Collapsed margins.
The following HTML demonstrates a collapsed margin. The vertical space between the
inner div elements is collapsed to 10 pixels, while the horizontal space between the span
elements is 20 pixels.

When an element has the property set to , the browser will compute the left and right
margins to use up the remaining width of the parent element. The margin value is useful for
horizontally centering an element in the parent element. A common error is to use
on elements that do not have the width specified or have , such as span
elements.

The universal selector, specified using an asterisk character ( ), matches a// elements in the
webpage. The universal selector is implied when an element name is not specified. Ex: The CSS
selectors and match exactly the same elements, where the universal
selector is implied in and explicit in
Multiple selector
The multiple selector, specified using a comma ( ) to separate selectors, matches all listed
elements to apply a style rule. Ex: The figure below shows two CSS examples that apply the same
styles to and elements. The CSS on the left unnecessarily duplicates the styling
declarations for and elements, whereas the CSS on the right uses a single style
declaration using a multiple selector.

background- color :
gray ;
color : white ;
font - weight : bold;
}
ol {
background- color :

color : white ;
font - weight : bold;
}
Child selector
The child selector, specified using a greater than character ( ) between two selectors, matches any
elements where the second element is a direct child of the first element. The child selector is
similar to the descendant selector (space between selectors), but the matching child element in the
child selector must be a direct child of the matching parent element.

The browser displays 'The name Neo is an anagram for One." Neo is bold and italicized with a
yellow background. One is italicized with a green background.

1 . The em elements are descendants of the paragraph element, so the descendant selector
matches both elements.

specified using a tilde character ( ~) between two selectors, matches the second element if the
second element occurs after the first element and both elements are siblings. Any number of other
elements can be placed between two general sibling elements. In the example below, the heading
and the paragraphs are children of the element. Consequently, the two paragraphs are

2.7 Flexbox
Flexbox container and items
The Flexible Box or flexbox is a CSS layout mode that provides an efficient way to lay out elements
in a container so the elements behave predictably when the container is resized or viewed on
different screen sizes.
A flex container is an element that has the CSS property display set to flex to create a blocklevel
flex container or inline-f lex to create an inline flex container. Ex:
<div style=" display: flex" >. Flex containers hold flex items. A flex item is a child element
of a flex container that is positioned and sized according to various CSS flexbox properties. I PARTICIPATION I 2.7.1 : Flexbox example renders three div elements on the same
ACTIVITY row.

• The flex-basis property sets the initial length of a flex item. The values can be (the
default), a percentage, or a length unit. The default value makes the flex item the same
initial length as the content.
• The flex-grow property sets a proportion that determines how much of the available
container space should be assigned to the item. The default is 0, meaning the size should be
based on the item's content.
• The flex-shrink property sets a proportion that determines the item's minimum size. The
default is 1, meaning the size should shrink at the same rate as other items when the
container width shrinks. A value of O means the item should not change sizes when the
container width shrinks.

Next three code blocks of CSS are shown. The first block shows the following:

list-style-type: none;

The second:

And the third:
nav Ii {

flex-basis: 1 OOpx;
flex-shrink: O;

text-align: center;
Below each CSS code block there is a screen displaying the output. The first shows Home,
Product, and About in a row across the top. The second first shows the three nav links leftaligned
in a row when flex-grow is 0, then portions the nav links evenly when flex-grow is 1. The
third box shows the three nav links changing container size when the browser is resized when
flex-shrink is 0, then flex-shrink is changed to 1, preventing the containers from resizing.
Animation captions:
1. A website's navigation links are displayed in an unordered list.
2. Making the ul element a flex container places the nav links on the same row.
3. By default, the Ii elements have flex-basis:auto and flex-grow:O, so Ii elements are only as
wide as the item's content.
4. Changing flex-grow from the default Oto 1 gives all Ii elements the same proportion. The
elements fill the flex container.
5. Replacing "flex-grow:1" with "flex-basis:1 OOpx" makes each Ii element 1 OOpx wide.
6. Resizing the browser changes the container size. When the container shrinks, the Ii
elements shrink to fill the available space.
7. Changing flex-shrink from the default 1 to O prevents the Ii elements from shrinking when
the browser is resized .

nav {
flex: 0 1 20%;

main {
flex: 0 1 60%;
}
aside {
flex: 0 1 20%;
}
In the CSS flex property, the 0 controls flex-grow, the 1 controls flex-shrink, and the percentage
controls flex-basis. Below is a screen displaying header spanning the width at the top of body,
footer spanning the width at the bottom of body, and between the two is <nav> occupying 20% of
the left side of body, main occupying 60% of the middle of body, and aside occupying the
remaining 20% of body on the right side.
Animation captions:
1. <header> and <footer> span the entire width of <body>, but the <div> is a flex container that
displays the flex items on the same row.
2. <nav>, <main>, and <aside> all have flex-grow= 0, so all three flex items' width should be
based on each item's content.
3. <nav>, <main>, and <aside> all have flex-shrink= 1, so all three flex items shrink at the same
rate when the browser is resized.
4. <nav> occupies 20% of the row, <main> occupies 60%, and <aside> occupies 20%. 20% +
60% + 20% = 1 00% of the row.

O All three flex items are stacked
on top of one another.
O The direction of the flex items
is reversed .
I PARTICIPATION I . ACTIVITY 2.7.9: Flexbox practice.
The webpage displays three years of Grammy Award nominations for Album of the Year.
Each year's nomination is placed in a <section>
element.
Alter the webpage to display the three sections in a single row:
1. Add a single <div> element that surrounds all three sections.
2. Add the proper CSS so the <div> becomes a flex container and displays each
section on a single row.
3. Add a flex property to the section rule that sets flex-grow to 0, flex-shrink to 1,
and flex-basis to 250px.
4. Add a flex-wrap property that makes the sections wrap to the next row when the
browser is resized.
After adding the HTML and CSS above, render the webpage. Resize the rendered
webpage's window and verify that the sections wrap to the next row when the window
isn't wide enough to display the sections side-by-side.

o So far this year, 7 4 rattlesnake bites to humans have been reported to the Arizona
Poison and Drug Information Center. Based at the University of Arizona College of
Pharmacy, the center serves the entire state of Arizona with the exception of Maricopa
County, providing free and confidential poison and medication information to callers
around the clock.
o Specialists answering the phones at the center regularly receive calls from Arizonans of
all ages who don't realize they were bitten by a rattler. The poison center urges anyone
who feels a mysterious sting, pinch or bite while outdoors to immediately call the center
at 800-222-1222.
o "We will ask a few questions that will help you either identify possible snakebite or
eliminate it," said Keith Boesen, director of the Arizona Poison and Drug Information
Center. "With snakebite, the sooner the medical treatment, the better the outcome, so
calling us right away can make a very big difference for the victims and the medical
teams treating them."
o The center advises anyone who might come cross paths with rattlesnakes to be aware
of these five things:
• An ordered list with the following item contents (in order):
•
o Baby rattlesnakes range in length from 6 to 12 inches and are easily camouflaged by
brush and grass.
o Baby rattlesnakes are rattleless until they first shed their skins, so there will be no
infamous "chica-chica" sound before they strike.
o Despite their impish size, baby snakes have enough venom to be very dangerous if they
bite a human.
o Adult rattlesnakes do not always rattle an audible warning before or while they are
biting.
o It's a good idea to call the poison center if you notice an unidentified small cut or
wound, even if you feel no pain. With the lack of telltale rattle warning, people can be
bitten without knowing what has happened until they notice their symptoms and
attribute them to a snakebite.
