Objects as maps
A map or associative array is a data structure that maps keys to values. Each key/value pair in a
map is called an element.
JavaScript objects can be used as maps, in which the key is the object property and the value is the
property's value. When an object is used as a map, individual elements are accessed by key using
brackets. Ex:
IAP ACRTTIVICITIPYA TION I 3.10.1: State capitals in an obJ·ect map.
l et stateCapi ta l s = {
AR : " Little Rock" ,
CO : " Denver " ,
NM : "Sante Fe "
} ;

stateCapi ta l s [ " TX" ] = "Austin" ;

stateCapitals[''TX"] = "Austin";
End code segment.
Memory for stateCapitals shows four elements with two letter state codes as keys and capitals
as values: AR/''Little Rock", CO/"Denver", NM/"Santa Fe", and TX/"Austin".
Console displays:
CO capital is Denver
Animation captions:
1. An object map called stateCapitals is initialized with three key/value pairs, creating three
elements.
2. The map's value for key "CO" is "Denver".
3. The capital of Texas, with key ''TX" and value "Austin", is added to the map.

For-in loop
0
0
The for-in loop iterates over an object's properties in arbitrary order and is ideal for looping through
an object map's elements. The for-in loop declares a variable on the left side of the keyword and
an object on the right. In each iteration, the variable is assigned with each of the object's properties.

Create an object map called that stores a university department's course
number as the key and an object as the value. The object has three properties:
. Example courses:
• 770 - Introduction to Programming, Develop algorithms for computers, 5.
• 250 - Web Development, Build web applications, 3.
• 31 O - Operating Systems, Process management and memory management, 3.
• 430 - Artificial Intelligence, Simulate human thinking, 2.
Then, write a for-in loop that displays the course number and title for only those courses
that are 3 credit hours.
Other object map operations
Other common operations performed on object maps include:
• Get number of elements. The Object.keys() method returns an array of an object's property
names. The array's property returns the number of elements in the object map.
• Check for key. The in operator returns if an object contains the given property and
returns otherwise.
• Remove element. The delete operator removes a key/property from a map or object.

Map object
The Map object is a newer alternative to using objects for storing key/value pairs. Common
methods and properties of the object include:
0
• The set(key, value) method sets a key/value pair. If the key is new, a new element is added to
the map. If the key already exists, the new value replaces the existing value.
• The get(key) method gets a key's associated value.
• The has(key) method returns true if a map contains a key, false otherwise.
• The delete(key) method removes a map element.
• The size property is the number of elements in the map.
The for-of loop, which is often used to loop through an array, is ideal for looping through a
Each of the map's key/value pairs are assigned to the
of loop, as illustrated in the animation below.

Animation content:
The following code is displayed:
let stateCapitals = new Map();
stateCapitals.set("AR", "Little Rock");
stateCapitals.set("CO", "Denver");
stateCapitals.set("NM", "Santa Fe");
console.log("Size of map is"+ stateCapitals.size);
if (stateCapitals.has("CO")) {
console.log("CO capital is"+ stateCapitals.get("CO"));
}
console.log("AII capitals:");
for (let [state, capital] of stateCapitals) {
console.log(state +"is"+ capital);
}
Step 1 runs the first line and stateCapitals is initialized to a map object with nothing stored.
Step 2 runs the following code:
stateCapitals.set("AR", "Little Rock");
stateCapitals.set("CO", "Denver");
stateCapitals.set("NM", "Santa Fe");.
The map stateCapitals is populated with keys: AR, CO, and NM. Each key is associated with a
memory location storing the strings: Little Rock, Denver, and Sante Fe.
Step 3 runs the following line of code:
console.log("Size of map is"+ stateCapitals.size);.
Size of map is 3 is displayed in the console.
Step 4 runs the following if block:
if (stateCapitals.has("CO")) {
console.log("CO capital is"+ stateCapitals.get("CO"));
}.
CO capital is Denver is displayed in the console.

Step 5 runs the following code:

for (let [state, capital] of stateCapitals) {
console.log(state +" is "+ capital);
}.
The following lines are displayed in the console:
All capitals:
AR is Little Rock
CO is Denver
NM is Sante Fe
Animation captions:
1. A new Map object is created with the Map() constructor.
2. The set() method adds three key/value pairs to the stateCapitals Map.
3. The size property returns 3 because stateCapitals has three key/value pairs.
4. The has() method returns true because "CO" is one of the keys in stateCapitals. The get()
method returns the value associated with "CO".
5. The for-of loop assigns each key/value pair to variables state and capital.
