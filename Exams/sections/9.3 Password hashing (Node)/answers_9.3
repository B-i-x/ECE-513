[9.3.1] (B) Converting passwords into a fixed-length hash digest
[9.3.2] (C) AES
[9.3.3] hash digest
[9.3.4] Plain text passwords should not be stored because they can be easily accessed and misused by unauthorized individuals during a data breach.
[9.3.5] (C) pgreen is denied access
[9.3.6] (A) Using a salt, (C) Applying a strong hash function like bcrypt
[9.3.7] The purpose of using a salt is to ensure that identical passwords generate different hash values, which makes precomputed dictionary attacks more difficult.
[9.3.8] Not the same
[9.3.9] (D) The string of 16-byte salt value encoded to 22 characters
[9.3.10] (B) It's slower, making it more resistant to brute force attacks
